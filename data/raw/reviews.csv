Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Home Sweet Home,B000WUFVR0,David C.,"I usually have good experience with Yankee Candles.  But 2 of the 3 I bought on Amazon were duds.  Both Sparkling Cinnamon candles only burned about 50% of the wax before the wicks were spent.  I always trimmed the wicks per the instructions on the bottom, but one of them sooted really badly and neither burned properly. On the first, about 1.5 inches from the bottom, the wick burned out because it was folded over and didn't go to the bottom of the candle.  The other one burned with such a low flame that it burned a hole down into the wax without melting half of it.  I've never had this problem with Yankee Candles purchased at a local brick and mortar store for $20+.  Perhaps these $13 units on Amazon are factory rejects? On a positive note, they smelled good.  Just wish I would have gotten them to burn thoroughly. I don't think I'll be buying any more of these off of Amazon.",2.0,2019-01-18,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000WUFVR0/?pageNumber=1
Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Home Sweet Home,B000WUFVR0,Vanessa,"I don‚Äôt think this is a real yankee candle. The wax was filled all the way to the top covering the wicks, making it unusable unless i‚Äôm able to scrape the wax away. Further, i noticed that it did not come with a proper Yankee Candle lid.  I attached photos of a real yankee candle next to the one i purchased.",1.0,2018-12-16,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000WUFVR0/?pageNumber=1
Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Home Sweet Home,B000WUFVR0,keith e.,"If you like a cinnamon scent with a hint of apple thrown in, then you'll love this candle.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Home Sweet Home,B000WUFVR0,Concerned Citizen,"I read reviews of this and another version where apparently neither candle has much if any scent at all. So I ordered both versions to test them before sending them as gifts to others and it's true, essentially no scent. You might as well just buy a red candle, or alternatively pay more for one that is worth it.",1.0,2018-11-27,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000WUFVR0/?pageNumber=1
Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Home Sweet Home,B000WUFVR0,Wayne Connell,"I purchase Yankee Candles regularly, an array of different scents throughout the year. Every 8th or 9th purchase yields a candle that is so devoid of fragrance as to make dubious the claim that it is a scented candle at all. This purchase of Sparkling Cinnamon is another example. After burning it for at least two hours, it smelled like ... absolutely nothing. Even inhaling deeply near the lip of the burning candle yielded no discernible scent. Yankee Candle needs to do a better job ensuring consistency of formula and product design. It is frustrating to pay $27 for a ""scented"" candle that is, in fact, unscented.",1.0,2016-09-18,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000WUFVR0/?pageNumber=1

I apologize for such a long video, but I wanted to capture the candle shooting flames into the air. I bought 3 candles. The other two are excellent. However, this one ‚ÄúHome Sweet Home‚Äù just snaps, cracks, sizzles, and shoots flames out the top. That‚Äôs if I can get it lit.  I‚Äôve NEVER seen a candle do this.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Home Sweet Home,B000WUFVR0,Kristen S,"I love,love,love this candle!!! It does not have a good odor, it has an amazingüòäüòòüòäüòòone!!! It has a scent just as you'd think cinnamon should smell. My neighbors smoke üö¨ 24/7 and it makes me nauseated. I've asked them to please turn on their exhaust, but they don't all time, which I think is rude.  Lighting the one wick (I wish they were two wicks. You know, to make it a stronger strength against the cigarette üö¨. The other Yankee candle has two wicks...the one that goes straight all the way up and doesn't curve inward at the top), but just lighting this candle helps against the cigarette üö¨ smell.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Home Sweet Home,B000WUFVR0,Renee,"I've been a Yankee Candle addict for well over 15 years, and this scent, ""Home Sweet Home,"" is the only one I use year-round! This purchase was delivered a day early and is a REAL Yankee Candle, not fake (believe me, I would know immediately if they were). People have asked me why I always buy the Yankee Candle brand? Because they're more expensive than others. I explain to them that I have bought other ""knockoffs"" to save money before, only to end up getting exactly what I paid for...wasted wax without any scent at the last 1/3 to 1/4 of the jar üòí, so they didn't save me anything. I don't work for the company, but I am a stickler for being well informed, so I know why the Yankee Candles cost more than their competitors... See, other companies only use their scented wax at the top 3/4 or 1/2 of their candle products, the bottom is just colored wax with a hint of scent. This way, they are able to trick the average customer into buying them. Don't get me wrong, at first, they all have great ""throw,"" however, as they burn down, their scent becomes much weaker. Some brands don't even use wicks long enough for their candles, causing them to fizzle out long before they should. Yankee Candle Company uses fully scented wax throughout the entire candle. They also have a high concentration of scented oils, to insure a strong throw of scent, from the first time you light it until it burns all the way down. *** P. S. Make sure you buy the REAL THING, not a cheap knockoff. I noticed that the complaints here are all about the ""Cinnamon Sparkle"" scent. Even though they're listed under the ""Home Sweet Home"" one. I ordered 2 of the ""Home Sweet Home"" scent here, and they're real Yankee Candle brand. If you get a fake one, like some of the other customers, report it to Amazon immediately! Amazon is just a distributor. They'll accept a return, even if your candle is burned to the wick, refund your money, then investigate to persecute the dirty posers!***",5.0,2021-07-02,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000WUFVR0/?pageNumber=2
Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Home Sweet Home,B000WUFVR0,Just sayin'..,"I have had this scent for almost 20 years, give it take. The last one I had was bought about 5ish years ago and cycled seasonly with other Yankee Candles. It definitely always had a cinnamon smell but not like this. This one is almost satirical! This Home Sweet Home candle has such an exaggerated cinnamon smell, it burns the throat to smell it! You'll notice I made a point to let it be known I haven't bought a HSH Yankee candle in about 5 years. I did that incase Yankee has changed the formula to increase the Cinnamon. Or maybe it was a mistake buying on Amazon? Maybe it's a second? Or maybe I am just getting old and my olfactory glands are 'going' first? The only problem with the latter is the previous HSH candle I had was at it's wicks end and I was able to compare. So if it's my olfactory senses, they went haywire overnight. Yankee offers candles with Cinnamon in the name to let it be known cinnamon is what you're going to get. Wow, if they are more 'cinnamony' than this, it would double as a tear gas agent. Just imagine putting a Yankee cinnamon candle on a warmer during the holidays. One could clear out any family or friend visitors from sheer discomfort alone! This HSH is more than half way there. One could use this to politely clear any guests out of the home. It's just too much!",2.0,2021-12-19,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000WUFVR0/?pageNumber=2

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Home Sweet Home,B000WUFVR0,danielle kristjanson,"This Yankee Candle smells amazing! It smells like a variety of warm spices and it has a hint of sweetness to it. It's not your typical fall scent so it can be used all year long, but it still puts me in the holiday spirit. I noticed it filled my entire bedroom with fragrance within only 20 minutes, which isn't typical for Yankee Candle nowadays. A lot of Yankee Candles are hit and miss in recent years with issues such as tunneling and no throw, but this candle was a hit! It's melting to the edges and smells lovely.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Home Sweet Home,B000WUFVR0,Big Daddy and Babs,"First let me say that my wife and I are Yankee Candle lovers. It is the only brand of candles we purchase. Over the course of many years we have only had a few issues with their products. This was the first time we purchased the Sparkling Cinnamon scented candles which we wanted for the holidays and in regards to this variety they did not throw much scent at all, about halfway burned it started throwing a great deal of soot which was all over our coffee table and ,because of the double wicks, the candles burned twice as fast. This is a trick with every candle maker. The more wicks, the faster they burn and the more often you have to buy new candles. Please keep this in mind when buying candles. I would not recommend purchasing this particular holiday scent, but they have a great many of other high quality candles that we love. Our favorite is the single wick large pillar Midsummer Night scented candles. They give off a great deal of scent, that fragrance is wonderful (in our opinion-of course) and they last a month or more of daily use.",2.0,2020-01-29,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000WUFVR0/?pageNumber=2

I find it hard to believe, that this is even a real Yankee Candle. If it is, I will never buy one again. It smells good when you open the box.

Even after all the warnings, all the people who were like, THERE IS NO SMELL, i was like, but the RATINGS. they are so HIGH. Don't be fooled. I have been burning this dumb candle for a whole day and it smells like MAYBE a cinnamon stick two rooms away sneezed into a tissue. And that is only if you have your face over the burning flame. And even then I wasn't even sure. The only time i smelled anything was when i first opened the candle, and it seemed to evaporate. Even after i closed it and tried to let the smell build up again nothing happened. DO NOT BUY IT. Save your money. Get two cinnamon sticks and rub them together.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Home Sweet Home,B000WUFVR0,RSS,"The scent is good if you like a really spicey aroma. I am not too happy about it but I hope the person I give it to likes the scent. Because it smells so spicey, I would recommend using it in a kitchen, breakfast room or dining room. I bought this to give to someone for a housewarming gift because the name of the candle is Home Sweet Home. I was very happy with the way this candle was packaged. It was wrapped very well in a shell of fitted cardboard and then boxed. It was delivered quickly and was completely intact, which is great because the candle is in a glass jar. I think this candle was too expensive, but I think all Yankee Candles are too expensive.

I have not had a scented candle for years, since this fragrance was hard to find in local stores.  When I found it on amazon, I ordered it.  The appearance of the candle was not as dark a red as I remembered; however, the most disappointing aspect - hardly any smell.  Yankee Candles were always known for their strong scents, and this one didn't really have any.  I had purchased another Yankee candle from a local store around the holidays, and this one really didn't provide much fragrance either.

It does contain one of those magical type aroma's I rarely notice, it's a good thing. If you like the smell of BAYBERRY then I strongly recommend trying this candle out.

My entire house smells like the inside of a box of Red Hots candies. Other people complain about there being no scent, so maybe there is some sort of issue with consistency in these candles, but let me tell you, the one I have has my house absolutely reeking of spicy cinnamon. I dont really like the smell but the price was so cheap that I gave it a shot thinking 'it's probably not that strong of a smell'. Man was I wrong.

Huge waste of money. They smell great and look great until you start using them. Reviews on the Yankle Candle website show the same poor quality feedback.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Home Sweet Home,B000WUFVR0,Bryan J. Mulholland,"I love the scent of Home Sweet Home. It's perfect to get you in the holiday spirit.  However, my experience mirrors that of numerous other reviews: this candle is the weakest Yankee Candle I've ever smelled.  With every other Yankee Candle, after one is lit, I can smell it throughout the entire house.  With this one, the only way I can smell it is if I bend down over the candle and take a deep whiff while it's burning. I've never had a problem with Yankee Candle's QC before.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Home Sweet Home,B000WUFVR0,Lyse M. Gunderson,"It also seems that it will only last that long IF it isn't burned CONTINUOUSLY for that amount of time.  The candle needs to rest and reset for it to last that long. I'm not impressed by the scent, but then again, I much prefer earthy or floral scents over food or spice flavored scents.  So vanilla cupcake, cinnamon stick, cookie dough or other such nonsense is not my thing in a candle.  By far my favorite is Yankee's Balsam and Fir. Now that's a candle!  Lavender? YES.

Candle has very very very faint smell after burning for 30 minutes . However I am use to a scent that one can smell throughout the house I have small house. Perhaps this candle by yankee scent does not agree with my taste in scents. I have this burning in my kitchen. I need to revise my first rating. After leaving the candle to burn longer, I Went outside for awhile and when I came back in and opened the door , I smelled the scent. I think that in all fairness that I should revise my rating. However that being said, I think that it is just a nice light scent compared to what I am use to. I have for years favored another brand scent for years when I decided to give yankee a chance. The ‚Äúsmells like burning wax‚Äù is no longer true. It has a light scent, but I think that this particular scent just doesn‚Äôt work for me.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Home Sweet Home,B000WUFVR0,Kindle Customer,Very disappointed. I don't buy many Yankee candles because they are too expensive for my budget. I splurged on this one since it is Christmas season. I love the Christmas smell of balsam and the spicy scent of cloves. This candle has very little scent (had scent the first time I burned it but that has faded out) and what it has smells more like baby powder. Absolutely no clove scent at all and no balsam scent either.

Home Sweet Home is my all time favorite Yankee Candle scent and this one must have been a quality control reject. First the wick was so short I could barely get it to light. Yankee candle lovers know you always need to trim the wick. Second there is barely a scent! I even tried leaving the candle lit in my bedroom with the door closed for 3 hours. I expected to be hit with the scent when I entered the room but it didn‚Äôt happen. Will stick with shopping directly with Yankee Candle shops.,2.0,2020-01-14,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000WUFVR0/?pageNumber=5

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Spiced Pumpkin,B000W3V8S8,Courtney G,"I am very disappointed in this candle.  I have been buying authentic Yankee Candles for 20+ years and I‚Äôve never had such a low quality dud. This candle had no scent and the wick burned so quickly that I had to dump out wax so the flame would stay lit.  Even after dumping out wax, the wick burned unusually fast (for a Yankee candle). I went out and bought a comparable Yankee Candle from a reputable, authorized dealer and the difference was night and day. The candle I purchased from the dealer was exactly what I was used to seeing in a real Yankee Candle.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Spiced Pumpkin,B000W3V8S8,Kyle H,"During pretty much any time of year I'm burning candles. I've burned cheaper ones like ""American home"" or ""village candle"" and I've burned nicer one's like ""yankee"" or ""kringle"". The cheaper candles are always faster burning and less fragrant. It's worth it to get a decent candle. Unless you REALLY want a specific (usually seasonal) scent, don't pay more than around 18$ for one of these. I've seen a bunch on here for like 25$+ and at that cost you're better off ordering kringle or some ""artisan"" brand. For 18ish bucks this candle is fantastic. This specific scent has lasted longer than some others, in that everyday I light it I can still smell it despite burning it for a week. Your nose and sense of smell is logarithmic (like your other senses) and after you have been exposed to the same smell for long enough, your brain stops recognizing it as unique and potent to your environment. It helps to buy several scents and rotate between them.",5.0,2020-10-19,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000W3V8S8/?pageNumber=2

At first I thought it was just air bubbles, but after getting a magnifying glass out and looking at it, it is definitely mold. I called customer service and they said I may have to return it for my refund. Which means I have to take it across town to the UPS store to return it.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Spiced Pumpkin,B000W3V8S8,Karina-Oh!,"It's worth the effort to always see what Amazon Warehouse has in stock before you buy your item. I've gotten in the habit of doing this when I'm looking for a Yankee Candle. I found a Spiced Pumpkin large jar candle just a couple of days ago that was reduced to $13.39. So I decided to give it a shot. All of my past experiences have been good and this one was no exception! It arrived 1 full day early & it was very carefully packed. Upon opening, the jar was in excellent condition. Everything about the candle is authentic Yankee quality. However, when I removed the glass lid I saw that the wick was slightly singed, yet none of the wax surrounding it had been melted. Sort of like it had been lit and immediately blown out. It wasn't intended to be a gift; but if it was it wasn't giftable, so I rated it only 1 star for that category. I lit my candle and in a few seconds, no one was the wiser, lol...

But, it appears that during production the wax was old or something as there are a lot of what appears to be air bubbles through out the wax in the jar. Since its not a gift I went ahead and lit the wick. It is a faint scent, smells good, but hardly able to smell it unless I'm right up on the candle.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Spiced Pumpkin,B000W3V8S8,Joe E.,"I have purchased many different brands of candles over the years trying to find a company that competes in its fragrances with Yankee candles. I finally decided several years ago that I would only buy Yankee candles and stop wasting my money on the other brands, since I am always disappointed with them. I was thrilled when I found my favorite Cranberry Chutney jar candle available on Amazon a couple of weeks before Christmas. However, as I have burned it over the past several days, I have been extremely disappointed. My house used to be filled with the delicious aroma from this candle, but this time, I can barely smell it. I have heard the excuse that people are complaining about Yankee candles' scents this year due to a loss of smell from Covid-19. That is not the case with me, because I have not contracted covid, and my sense of smell is just fine. If other people are complaining, I have a feeling the Yankee Candle Company has changed something in the way it adds the different fragrances to their candles, so now, they are less potent than they always have been. I want a candle that can fill my house with a delicious scent, not one that I have to keep trying to smell!

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Spiced Pumpkin,B000W3V8S8,Lanie,"I've been purchasing Yankee Candle products (mainly candles) for over 20 years and can say without a doubt in my mind that it doesn't matter if you purchase from an authorized dealer or from the Yankee Candle website or in a corporate store, the majority of the time you aren't going to get much of a scent release from many of their candles when they are burning.  Their quality (or scent release) is just not even close what it used to be and that's a shame because they used to be the beast of candles when it came to scent.  If you are looking for a candle that has a lot of scent to it, Yankee is not the company to look at anymore and hasn't been for a while now. That said, I also think that this candle was worth the price that I paid for it.  I grabbed two of them for less than $10 each with free shipping.  That price changed how satisfied I am with the product and did effect my review rating and satisfaction level.  Hopefully that makes sense. Autumn Wreath does smell good when it is cold and the name fits the cold scent notes very well.  It really doesn't have much scent at all when it is lit.  I've had multiples of this one from a couple of different places that I caught on deep sale or clearance and not one performed better than any of the others. I placed this candle into a Yankee jar candle holder with the illuma lid hoping that the illuma lid would help because sometimes they do.  Unfortunately the extra heat that the illuma lid provides did not increase the scent release in this candle.  It just looks really pretty in the holder sitting on my kitchen counter. I will usually burn a candle that has a strong scent over by my stove at the same time so I have the ambiance of two candles burning but the scent of only one.  In an odd way, I actually like that I can practically count on Yankee to have zero scent release when burning so I can create a nice comfy look and feel, without multiple candles having a scent war that can give me a headache.  That is now the beauty of Yankee Candle and Autumn Wreath. All in all I think this candle is today's version of a typical Yankee Candle and that's why I gave it three stars.  It's a large candle that provides ambiance and looks pretty in a jar holder.  Nothing more, nothing less.",3.0,2019-02-04,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000W3V8S8/?pageNumber=3

That being said, the Autumn Wreath Candle by Yankee Candle is very disappointing.  This candle has no scent what so ever unless you count the smell given off by a typical unscented candle.  Perhaps these candles lose their scent over time and this just happens to be a very old candle at the time of my purchase.  I also had made a gift of a second Autumn Wreath candle to a close friend and she also stated that her candle had no scent either.

On 6 candles, 3 large jars, 1 large two wick tumbler, and 2 perfect pillars, the wicks will burn to the level of the wax before the top of the wax is fully melted to the edges of the glass.  The worst of the bunch was my latest, a two-wick tumbler in ""Crisp Fall Night"". After the 6 prior candles I bought with 6 bad wicks, I waited for a year before I bought this newest candle.  I see it's still the same.  The Crisp Fall Night candle didn't make it past 1.5 hours until the wicks were burned right to the wax level.  I don't have this problem with any other brand.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Spiced Pumpkin,B000W3V8S8,Ariana,"What‚Äôs not to love about a nice fall/winter candle? I chose this scent because it has a lot of spice accents to it, so I can use it when fall is approaching, but I can also use it as a Christmas candle because of the warm spice scents. I also purchased one for my stepdad and he uses it all the time - and it‚Äôs still very full, so he‚Äôll get a lot more use out of it. I love Yankee Candles because they tend to last a super long time, so they may be more pricey sometimes but it‚Äôs worth the money. Not to mention, sometimes Yankee Candles sold on Amazon are marked down to $15 or $16 as opposed to the full $30 price that Yankee Candle sells them for in their stores and on their website.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Spiced Pumpkin,B000W3V8S8,Lea B,This scent is great for fall and smells just like pumpkin and cinnamon. Plus I got a great deal ($10.98) However whoever packed the box ruined the candle. The candle itself was wrapped well but when the packer put the 2 candles in the Amazon box they clearly did not pay attention to the image and words saying to keep the Yankee candle box upright (listed on every side of the box) and instead put them on their side. Needless to say the candles melted in the summer heat (luckily this pumpkin one stayed mostly intact except for the melted remnants around the rim/lid). My other candle did not fare as well. This is something Amazon should monitor as this issue could‚Äôve been avoided.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Spiced Pumpkin,B000W3V8S8,Guts,"Almost literally. You are burning your money away every time you light it. TL;DR: maybe I am not a candle connoisseur, but I was really expecting that all of the wax would burn with the wick. It does not - lots of left over wax along the walls of the jar. Also, scent although nice isn't very strong (maybe a plus for some folks). --- What are you supposed to get in return? A nice relaxing scent? I suppose so - but it's not that strong. Was hoping to use this to combat kitchen odor after cooking something... fragrant, but it's barely noticeable. Also, the wick burns too quickly and doesn't draw enough wax? I was expecting the heat from the flame would melt the wax, and the wick would draw the molten wax as fuel for the flame. That way as the wick goes down, so does the wax. However, with this candle, the wick's going down but a bunch of wax remains on the sides of the jar... I guess I'll scrape it down and buy extra wick to utilize the remaining wax?",3.0,2020-02-28,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000W3V8S8/?pageNumber=4

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Spiced Pumpkin,B000W3V8S8,Lightworker USA,"With homes being all sealed up to keep utility bills down, we've lost the smells of the outdoors. Yankee has a winner here... it just smells like FALL. Jumping into piles of raked leaves, the faintest smell of leaves burning (very faint) with hints of pumpkins and spicy things. We live in the center of South Carolina, and as transplanted Yankees, we miss the 4 seasons. Spring and fall are both very brief, so we swiftly go from sweltering humid to cold and rainy with about 6 weeks in between. Don't get me wrong - South Carolina is a wonderful place to live, & as my husband says, ""You don't have to shovel rain."" He's a native of upstate New York, a veteran of a LOT of lake-effect snow... so we have Spring & Fall vicariously through Yankee candles' wonderful aromas.

This candle from Amazon vendor has a very weak scent. Past purchases had scents so strong the fragrance required burning a short 10 minutes only.  I have burned this fake candle almost 2 hours to only get a faint Autumn Harvest scent by sniffing near the jar. Having bought a same scent Yankee Candle from a reputable, authorized dealer, I am astounded at the difference being night & day.

I lit the candle and went into another room to test it out. I waited to see if the fragrance would carry over to the room I was in, because that‚Äôs what happens with my other Yankee Candles. I checked periodically and there was zero scent. The only time I smelled anything at all was if I stood directed over the candle and put my face close to the top. This is ridiculous.

The only time I can smell the scent is if I put the candle right up to my nose.  I have it right now sitting on the end table just under 2 feet from me and I cannot smell it.  I remember how they used to be so filled with scent that you could smell it all through the house.  I used to justify the expense of these candles by the quality.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Spiced Pumpkin,B000W3V8S8,Josh h.,"I give this a 4 star for value for money because the burn is nice and slow, the frangrance strong, and the size big. BUT... I honestly cant stand the smell! I bought 2 different brands of Pumpkin Spice candles before this (McCalls Country Canning and The Candle Daddy) trying to find my favorite for the best price and this smell was NOTHING like any other pumpkin spice candle i have ever smelled. It's super sweet like a fake sweet, like super strong candy smell.... It literally has made me nauseous. I've let it burn for 4 hours now, hoping that it would heat up and smell better, but definitely not. Maybe this particular scent is just not for me. Also, it arrived with some oily crud stuck all the way around the inner part of the lid, not a big deal, just gross.",2.0,2018-10-24,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000W3V8S8/?pageNumber=12

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Spiced Pumpkin,B000W3V8S8,Roberta L. Gay,"The scent of this candle is, to me, the epitome of autumn. I just adore it. So many visitors to our home have sniffed and said, ""What is that scent and where can I get it?"" There are other autumn-y scents for Yankee Candles, such as Autumn Wreaths, but my guests and I really do prefer this one - perhaps a little less sweet than the others, a bit more earthy. The medium candles, in my experience, burn more clearly and evenly than the other sizes, although that may have more to do with the shape and size of my living room, and the placement of our windows, than anything intrinsically pertaining to the jar-size.",5.0,2013-01-01,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000W3V8S8/?pageNumber=30

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Macintosh,B007FSDIJA,Maria Robin Estes,"I ordered 2 of these candles which were sold by the same company. They were shipped and arrived on different days. I‚Äôm still trying to understand why. Both candles were shipped poorly. The 1st had the top tapped as if done by an elementary student and thrown in a box. The 2nd appeared to have been taped, but somehow the top became detached and it was shipped in an envelope. What I noticed upon opening the envelope was lack of fragrance. I cleaned away the tape and decided to light the candle and burn for a couple of hours. I was extremely dissatisfied. There was a very faint fragrance and the candle began to burn straight down the center. I‚Äôve purchased this candle in the past. I know how beautiful the fragrance is or should be and these candles last for a long time. The candle that I‚Äôve been using in my bathroom was purchased in November 2019 and while I don‚Äôt burn it every day. It is still very fragrant and after a year still has quite a bit of burn time left.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Macintosh,B007FSDIJA,Toby Moore,"This was purchased as a small Valentine's gift for my wife.  I had bought her a Lemon Verbena candle (different brand) for Christmas, which smelled really nice.  But then we noticed the terrible black soot it left on her home office walls and ceiling...so much for buying another.  She's had dozens of Yankee candles over the years with no issues, and this one was ""Amazon's Choice"" so I went for it.  Simply put, this jar missed the fragrance nozzle on the assembly line.  We're talking basically no lemon, unless you concentrate it in a very small location.  And even then you have to practically singe your eyebrows off leaning into it to smell anything.  Nothing like other Yankee stuff in the past.  Production mistake?  Yankee's new cost-cutting philosophy?  Who knows.  Just $17 wasted.  We'll go back to generic candles bought at the supermarket.

This was the only thing I could think of. The scent of this candle is ok, but not my favorite. If you like Hawaiian or Carribean types of scents, you would appreciate this candle a lot. I however don't, and got this candle only out of the ""cilantro"" curiosity which I don't understand what is doing on the label at all. The scent is pleasant and I will burn it since it is very enjoyable, it is somewhat ""thick"", sweet, tropical with a lot of pineapple to it. Reminds me of my Oahu vacation :) The scent is pretty prominent, not the most fragrant of other Yankees that I have, but I would rate it as medium on the fragrant scale. A good choice for someone who gets headaches from strong overwhelming scents. As other Yankees this lasts forever, I have used it quiet a few times now, and it is almost full (see the picture).

I don't smell any cilantro, unless it's the fresh aspect I smell with the candle. What I do smell when I burn it, is a smell identical to the smell I experience when I cut up a fresh, ripe, very sweet pineapple. That scent is very predominant in this candle. I also smell sweet coconut, but heavier on the pineapple. It's a perfect balance, and definitely a sweet smell, though not at all in a bad way. When I burn it, the throw is strong. I'd say a 7.5 or so, and it fills my room wonderfully. I can't recommend this one enough.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Macintosh,B007FSDIJA,Jane H,"This candle has a nice scent to it. That's the good part. However, it is super strong, which is the bad part for me. I like a lightly scented candle. This candle is super scented, and even in a really big, open area, it is very strong. I couldn't let it burn for more than a few minutes. I think I will need to put it away and get it out when warmer weather comes and I can burn it out on the sunporch with all the sliding doors open to the screens.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Macintosh,B007FSDIJA,Sheila H.,"My candle arrived safely packaged and in a timely manner. I love Yankee candles as they burn well and have a great fragrance. This one is a little different. While it burns nicely with the two wicks, the smell of Honey and Clementine aren't really there. After burning in for three to five hours I can tell its more of a perfume type of smell over a natural citrus. It doesn't have a very good throw either as you need to be right up on it. Great candle but I'll try a different option for Orange/Citrus. Update- After burning for approximately 15- 20 hours it has gotten better. Better throw and scent. It just shouldn't take that long to be effective.",3.0,2021-03-22,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B007FSDIJA/?pageNumber=4
Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Macintosh,B007FSDIJA,Purpledog,"Smelled great out of the box: until I lit it. 3 hours of burn time, nice pool of warm wax and I can't smell a thing: not even when I put my nose to the flame (ok, almost!). It smelled amazing when I removed the lid and I couldn't wait to light it. Dreary, drizzly, damp October in New England and this would have made the day a lot more cheery. Right now, 3+ hours of burn time, and it is pretty much just a red, unscented jar candle. I'll keep it for power outages but as far as scenting the house, I suggest Red Apple Wreath - soft apples and cloves (I think. It is definitely not cinnamon - so I'm thinking cloves). The throw on that once isn't terrific, but compared to old Macintosh which has zero throw and zero scent once lit, it will do on this dreary day.",1.0,2018-10-08,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B007FSDIJA/?pageNumber=4

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Macintosh,B007FSDIJA,Ronni & Ray,Not happy at all. I normally buy the larger 28$ candle of the Honey Clementine but I decided to order this size.

It's not overbearing and it doesn't get too strong or sickly-sweet smelling when the candle is burning, which is an issue I have with many cheaper candles I buy. The 22 oz. jar is nice and big, and the packaging boasts over 100 hours of burn time, which I can attest to. I lit this one 2-5 hours a day for over 5 weeks before it burnt out. My only complaint would be that I still have probably a half of an inch of wax in the bottom of the jar, but my wick is completely burnt. This could be be due to the fact that I had to blow it out at one point, and if I had kept burning it, the wax would have been used up completely. Otherwise, this is a wonderful product--pineapple and cilantro aren't two scents you'd think to combine, but they're fantastic together!

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Macintosh,B007FSDIJA,Lucia C.,Other retailers candles/wax melt scents have been known to cause a headache and irritates my sinus cavity.

The large jar is an absolute great deal on sale! I highly suggest burning a minimum of 2-3 hours each time to avoid uneven wax around the outer circumference of the jar. Cheery bright yellow color.

Set Sail has Blue Musk, Lemon Tonic, Oak Moss, Ocean Air,Seawood, Teak. Kringle was created by the original owner/creator of Yankee Candles.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Vanilla Cupcake,B000X457HO,David S. Young,"I don‚Äôt know why Yankee Candles chose to dramatically reduce, or at times eliminate the scent in their candles. They were reknown for consistently strong scents, that wafted throughout your home, but no longer. I purchased 20 for gifts last Christmas, and no aroma at all could be smelled in 11 of them. Too late to buy other gifts or return them. I had them wrapped and distributed. I still feel guilty. Many Companies risk quality when mass produced for Amazon. I‚Äôll never buy another, anywhere. Without vigilent quality control batch testing, a manufacturer often goes bankrupt. Amazon must educate and inspect quality measures consistently, lest they sale garbage. However, as long as it sells, they could care less.",1.0,2019-03-05,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000X457HO/?pageNumber=1

It's absolutely wonderful to light about 20 minutes before I have my morning cup of coffee. There's just something special about the background of baking cookies while sipping coffee. My husband loves it too. Whenever he walks into room he says ""that candle smells so good!"" It arrived on Wednesday and I've been burning it every day. It's about half used. Not bad. Like other single-wick candles, the wax often needs to be scraped down the side otherwise a cavernous hole develops down the middle around the wick.

ZIP. Even when I put my nose right up to it, lit or unlit, I smell NOTHING. I usually buy the Woodwick Vanilla candles, which are phenomenal. I happened to have one stashed away, so got it out, lit it up, and the wonderful vanilla aroma filled the room, and the whole house.....along with the delightful fireplace-like crackle of a Woodwick candle.

Maybe it's an online scam, like it's a regular candle and they slap on a yankee label. The other candles, that actually have a scent, I bought at Bed Bath & Beyond.

The box and the protective enclosure inside was a little damaged, but that was it. So, I'm a happy camper with this purchase!

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Vanilla Cupcake,B000X457HO,Andre,"Great scent if you love birthday cake. Unfortunately everyone goes nose blind to scents after a while of being in the vicinity of a scent and after those few first glorious minutes of being in a room with this candle lit, you won't even notice the smell. That is ... until you walk out the room to so something (whether to go to the kitchen, bathroom, etc) and return to the room. Then the soothing smell of fresh birthday cake returns for a few minutes. Nose blindness is no fault of the candle. Just our stupid noses üò† Anyways I used this candle beyond what was recommended and had no issues. Do so at your own risk but I did use the candle until all the wax was nearly completely burned out. I've lit, put out, and relit this candle multiple times with no issue. So long as the bottom of the glass isn't getting hot there shouldn't be a risk of the candle and glass exploding. But then again, what do I know? Do so at your own risk but I just could not allow myself to stop using this candle once the wax reached below half. It smelled too good to waste. Also this candle is very aesthetically pleasing in a room. It blends in and the fire burning inside the glass jar just looks elegant.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Vanilla Cupcake,B000X457HO,SUE-ELLEN DAVISON,"Yankee Candle's primary claim to fame was always their marvelous scents. This Salted Caramel ""scented"" candle has none. The only scent you'll detect is if you stick your nose into the jar before lighting. Yes, there's a scent there, but no matter how long you burn it, you're never going to get to enjoy Salted Caramel or any other scent wafting about your room. It's just not there. And yes, my sense of smell is still good, thank you for asking. Also, the Yankee Candle makers, like all candle makers, used to know how to gauge the thickness of their wicks so that they burned down at the same rate that the wax melted. The company has stopped concerning themselves with that nicety since they've decided it's really their customers' job to constantly trim the wicks. If you overlook that, next thing you know, a six-inch flame will be shooting out of the jar threatening to crack it and/or set your curtains or something else on fire. Yankee Candle has evidently lost interest in selling a quality product. That might be all right if they had the decency to reduce their prices accordingly because their new product is  only worth the price of the jar. That, at least, can be used for something.

Also, since there is only one wick in this candle, it melted unevenly. It was kind of unsightly to look at. I tried hard to even out the candle but scraping the unmelted wax off, but sometimes it wouldn‚Äôt budge. Overall, I don‚Äôt recommend this candle.",1.0,2020-11-14,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000X457HO/?pageNumber=4
Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Vanilla Cupcake,B000X457HO,Marina,"I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews about the Yankee Candles not being authentic on Amazon, but figured I would try them since it was on sale. I wasn‚Äôt the biggest fan of this particular scent (Salted Caramel)  and it wasn‚Äôt very strong like some of them are. It did take a long time to burn which is something I appreciate since candles are so expensive.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Vanilla Cupcake,B000X457HO,Matt Wallenstein,"I like to burn candles in my apartment because I find that freshening sprays don't always last as long as I would like, and incense is just too strong and invasive for me to want to use it consistently. Yankee's salted caramel scent is probably my favorite one so far. It is extremely sweet-smelling as you would expect, but it is not sickeningly sweet like I was worried it would be. It almost reminds me of bread baking or fresh cookies. It is a very warm and soothing smell that I would not necessarily describe as subtle because it will definitely fill up a room, but it is not overpowering and becomes part of the scenery. I got the Bahama Breeze scent along with this, and while I like that one, the scent is not nearly as strong as this one and is much less noticeable. I would be cautious of giving this as a gift to someone because I could see some thinking it is overly sweet. I don't think it is, but I like sweet scents so I may have a higher tolerance than some people. On the same token, I definitely recommend trying this for yourself, it's definitely a treat and will make you feel cozy the whole time it's burning.",5.0,2020-08-13,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000X457HO/?pageNumber=5

There is nothing more frustrating than spending a good chunk of money on a candle that can't send out a fragrance (not even in the room that it's  placed in). The scent throw is very poor. The cold scent is also weak. My husband bought 5 Yankee Candles from Amazon.  Two Vanilla Cupcake, which is the worst of them. Two Spiced Pumpkin, which has a strong cold scent, but again little scent throw when lit. And the 5th candle, called Home Sweet Home, we haven't yet burned. Hopefully, results will be better. I guess Yankee Candle Co. has switched production materials since I last had their candle (it's been a long time).  I've been buying other candle brands & I love using wax melts.

There is also a weirdly spicy, musty undertone or quality to it that I can't quite explain. Whatever it is, the candle does NOT smell like creme brul√©e as someone else here claimed. Its cloying, heavily charred, burnt maple stench just sticks to the back of the throat like mad medicine. Plus, unlike some Yankee Candles, the stench is STRONG and lingers, so there is no escaping it before for quite a while afterwards. Even my poor dog's fur smelled of it for days. (Why are bad fragrances or aromas always the strongest or last forever?) Don't get me wrong, I like sweet, foody, gourmand-scented candles, but this one is dreadful.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Midsummer's Night,Black",B000ORX6WI,Mellie,"This candle (Midsummer Night) used to be one of the strongest scented (if not THE strongest) made by Yankee Candle. As I have written in many reviews on Amazon, and YC too, Yankee Candles have practically lost their scent. Almost 20 years ago, I saw these candles in a gift shop, and bought my first one (Ocean Water), and I was hooked. I actually became a crazy candle lady. Well over time, YCs became less and less scented (and no, it's not my nose, I've ruled that out). So I stopped buying them, though I went kicking and screaming. I now buy other brands that have stronger scents, but I miss the nice burn quality of YCs. Anyway, I bought this candle on impulse, thinking it just MIGHT still have some scent throw, since it used to be such a strong scent.  I burned it for the first time yesterday evening, for the recommended four hours for the large-jar style, and only got hints of the scent. It is the same one from days of yore but is greatly reduced in strength. I'm going to burn it again later today and decide if I can smell it enough to keep it. I hope I can decide to. And it really does have that good, consistent burn--no tunneling, soot, or anything like that. But what's up with the loss of scent, Yankee Candle? (I called the company one time, and they just blew me off). Update: I'm keeping this candle. I really enjoy it and its nice, consistent burn. I can smell it, but the scent is indeed greatly reduced compared to in the past. This is still probably one of the stronger scents offered by Yankee Candle, though most of them, these days, have practically any detectable fragrance.",3.0,2019-07-01,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000ORX6WI/?pageNumber=1

I was disappointed in the amount of cardboard that was used in the package. There were 3 boxes. And I can't recycle where I live so I try to not bring non reusable boxes into the house.

I literally have to lean over the candle and even then I can barely smell anything. The scent fades so quickly that even when the candle is burning, you still can not hardly smell it.

The smell is fantastic, once again, but it does not spread throughout the room very much, it either has to be near my hand or I have to literally pick it up to smell it well.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Midsummer's Night,Black",B000ORX6WI,Webster,"I bought several Yankee Candles at once with this type of flat,tin ""lid"" that simply ""sits on top"" of the jar..  Until now, I had always bought the chunky, tumbler glass ""lid. "" I decided to try this lid because the candle looked sleeker .  Anyways,..... when I went to burn it, it had NO  scent.  I tried another, then a third.  It seemed that perhaps because there  was no tight closure with the looser "" flat lid""  , the scent had ""worn off "" or ""worn away."" ""escaped""  When I mentioned this to my girlfriends at lunch, they had had the same experience with this kind of flat lid vs. the tight -fitting  glass, chunky lid.  So... If you want a lovely candle and are not looking for a scent,  this candle _style is for you. It burns slowly, ( all Yankee Candle do !!)  ,so you get more for your $.than a regular candle.  I just always buy Yankee Candles for their scent.  The scent is ALWAYS consistent, as is the quality of the product.  Yankee Candles don't get smokey as some candles often do. I'd also like to add that Yankee Candles do an excellent job wrapping and shipping their candles.  All the candles are well-wrapped and arrive amazingly fast. Bottom line ?  I LOVE  Yankee Candles . Great value for product and service.. I'd just  warn you to think twice before choosing the  candles with the ""flat lids.""  over other options.

The candle has a good scent (not sure if that's really eucalyptus) and once I coaxed out the wick, it worked. Not sure if it's the product manufacturer or the person/company that's shipping these! Or maybe it's just Amazon that doesn't pay attention who they allow here to sell stuff. For the price, I think I got jipped!

That is a huge factor for me.  I've purchased a couple different brands through Amazon that have arrived shattered. Only to have them replaced to have the replacement arrive shattered also. How does that? Yankee candle goes to great lengths to ensure their candles arrive to you just as they suppose to, all in one piece. This candle might be a bit strong smelling for some people, I however enjoy the deep woodsy smell this one gives off.  It's also a long burning candle.  Not one that you will light and then be almost empty  in a few short hours. I very much like that.

I contacted Yankee and they said that ""we use as much fragrance oil as possible to to create a smell that is true-to-life as possible while delivering a candle that will burn properly from beginning to the end."" They also said that there are factors that that could impact the scent such as room size, other odours present, air flow and temperature (which sounds like hog wash to me).

The first had almost no throw, the second, almost no throw apart from burning wick scent, and then there was this: Yankee Candle's Midsummer's Night. I like the scent, but is very much like cologne, strong and heady. And it's rarely ever on sale like some of YC's other offerings. My first clue that something was off was the fact that Amazon shipped my order from the other side of the country, which they never do. My second clue was that while the YC box was undamaged, the softer material cradling the candle was stained and reeked of the candle itself. Ignoring the warning sign, I pulled the candle out and found that it was partially covered in fragrance oil and dark dye. I opened the candle and fragrance oil and dark dye sprayed out, onto the kitchen counter, my right arm, and one of my favorite Old Navy t-shirts. My spouse was nice enough to bleach the stains off the counter for me, but I will not be able to get the spots out of my t-shirt. Anyway, the candle was melted. The long trip across the country must have been too hot for it. And despite washing my arm twice, the strong scent and stains wouldn't come off until I had my shower that night. So I stank of Midsummer's Night for the rest of the day.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Midsummer's Night,Black",B000ORX6WI,BodeMeister,"This candle does burn clean but requires some tender care to make sure the less heated sides are involved and have to be pushed in with a knife to get the full liquid head that is required for a great burn.  It is a great scent that starts out very pungent sage that luckily goes down and is a nice soothing scent that is good for any relaxing event.  i have had several Yankee candles and have to say the 2 wick ones with soy just aren't as aromatic and as long lasting as the mottled paraffin ones they are known for.  It burns clean but so do the paraffin ones and not sure what the advantage is unless you are able to determine a toxin/comparison between the two. When it domes down to burning this I usually have to push the 2 sides that are not near the flames inward so it burns evenly. It does have a great scent that is better after the first burn which is wickidly strong. I prefer the later stages of subtle scent of sage with a very small amount of citrus poiking out.  It lasts long  but not as much as their large paraffin wax candles that seem to last for a very long time.  Great thing is no soot, smells great after the first burn. The bad is very hot candle that needs constant attention and uneven wax burn.  I would not buy a 2 wick yankee again because of this.

This one provides about twice the candle for the same price as some other name brands on Amazon.  Here's why. Wick is cheap and mushrooms a lot.  I had to trim it constantly to keep the flames from growing very large. Wax is cheap and smokes quite a bit.  Crackles and pops too. Scent is okay. My wife bought me a Mainstays (Target Store Brand) and I think it burns nicer; less smoke and mushrooming.  Don't know how much she paid for it but it was probably less.,2.0,2020-06-01,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000ORX6WI/?pageNumber=5

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Midsummer's Night,Black",B000ORX6WI,Maleficara,"The scent is fantastic, if you can catch a whiff. The color and idea of the candle is fantastic. The scent, also fantastic. However, if you're used to the strongly scented, typical, Yankee Candle, this one is not for you. It is a lovely, masculine, scent. However even after a couple of hours of burn time it is not one that is going to perfume even the immediate area. You will get hints of the scent, a tease of it from time to time, and that's it. There were a few moments after I extinguished the candle that the scent was stronger than at any other time. If you are looking for a more subtle hint of fragrance, this may be for you.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Midsummer's Night,Black",B000ORX6WI,josh,"*14 DEC 2013 UPDATE: I've actually come around to the scent of this candle. I burn it more frequently and will definitely buy another when this one is done. It's potent and definitely appreciated by almost everyone that comes over to my house. Initially the candle is extremely overwhelming, and I'm even talking about when it is unlit. Within a couple weeks you'll love it. It's cheap and will definitely fill a whole house with a pleasant scent. Still, seek out the Voluspa candles. Their scents are more experienced and unique. Absolutely awesome candles. *ORIGINAL REVIEW: 24 yr old bachelor. I bought this because it was recommended as a 'manly' scent for my house. This smells like a cheap cologne / Axe Body spray, and to me it is a little overwhelming. Traveling with it, unlit in my car with the lid on gave me a slight headache. I don't have too much experience in candle selection but I would definitely seek this out before you purchase it. I know plenty of women out there probably appreciate this scent, and for the price you can't find too many masculine scents, but to me it reminds me of a frat house or a 16 year old kid getting ready for a date. I also purchased some Voluspa candles with this, and they are the best candles / scents I've ever experienced. The Voluspa scents I got are much more refined and resemble a more expensive and interesting cologne/guy smell. They are pricey, but I promise you they are worth it (buy the small sample sizes first) Here are the Voluspa scents that will blow you away: Suede Blanc, Ambre Lumiere, Warm Perique Tabac, Golden Cypress Sawara.",4.0,2013-05-31,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000ORX6WI/?pageNumber=11

The wick has burned all the way down to the bottom but the sides are all the way up to the top.  It's like it burned a hole down the middle without using all of the wax. If this candle was $7 I would expect better.  But over $20 this is unacceptable.  Worst part is that this is the 3rd o e that has done the same thing.

The price was better than YC, had free shipping, and it arrived safe and sound and uncracked. If you're curious about the smell, it smells exactly like warm laundry should smell, in my opinion. It's so inviting and soft, not too sweet and not too powerful. Just right. I'm a huge fan of fresh smells, sweet/tropical scents make me sick to my stomach.

She requested good quality & good smelling candles to help with the smell when she and her caregiver change her bag. I purchased the Balsam & Cedar, Lavender and Sparkling Cinnamon candles thinking that each would offer a pleasant and varied aroma depending on her mood. She was excited to receive the package and quickly tried each of the candles. Both she and her caregiver remarked that all three of the candles smelled ""cheap"", they said that ""they smell like Lysol"" and they're reminiscent of ""dollar store quality candles"". I am exceedingly disappointed. I expect more from Yankee Candle (a brand that I've personally used in my own home and normally have a high opinion of), I expect better quality for candles that cost more than $10 each. At the very least I expect for each of the candle aromas to be distinguishable from one another.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Balsam & Cedar,B000JDGC78,"BOB FROM MOUNTAIN HOME, AR","For a Yankee Candle, and the price I paid, I was very disappointed. The smell was non-existent. I thought Yankee were once the best? Apparently greed must have killed them like it does so many businesses these days. You get people running the biz that want to start using cheaper quality materials to make more profit, and they raise prices to ridiculous levels because people love their products. Only they don‚Äôt realize people aren‚Äôt as stupid as they hoped. The people begin to realize that they just aren‚Äôt as good as they once were and they are WAY out of the ballpark now for the Quality to Cost ratio. So people try another brand and go wow, that‚Äôs a great candle! And they never go back. They then talk to their friends about it and the friends ‚Äúwake up‚Äù and go ‚Äúyour right, their candles just aren‚Äôt that great anymore. Their prices have gotten ridiculous anyway.‚Äù It is now that they switch too over to that other brand that really knows how to make a great smelling candle, that stays smelling great, until the last bit of life leaves the flame on the wicks. I know for a fact that this happens as stated above. It is from direct experiences on my part, multiple times as well. I even started polling our friends and the majority of them actually verified the same sentiment. That Yankee Candles, which used to be everyone‚Äôs favorite, have gone downhill so badly and have gotten so crazy expensive, that it just does not make sense to keep wasting the amount of time I have to work to pay for them. I work hard. I want quality for my money and time. I‚Äôm not going to spend an hour working to throw away on garbage. Companies don‚Äôt respect the people who work to pay their salaries. The only thing they care about is my money and not the time I slaved at work just to purchase their crappy product. What happened to the days when ‚Äúcustomers come FIRST‚Äù? They‚Äôre gone and now it‚Äôs only about taking your money/time and passing it on to the fat executive that‚Äôs destroying their brand, just to make themselves and their greedy shareholders fatter and richer off the backs of those who do the REAL work in this world.... just for the privilege of buying their overpriced trinkets.",1.0,2020-11-25,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000JDGC78/?pageNumber=3

Extremely disappointed: hardly any scent unless I stick my nose into the unlit candle, the wicks are not centered on either one so they burn crooked and the wax pools so badly because of the crooked wick that even with rotating the candle countless times during the burning hours, it extinguishes the wick time and time again and still forms that carbon ball at the top of the wick. That causes a very high flame when next ignited so trimming is necessary. Just a huge disappointment.

I chose this scent specifically because people claimed it was one of their stronger offerings. It seemed fine at the start, but once I got about 1/3rd into the jar, the scent pretty much went away completely unless I was standing directly on top of the candle while it was lit. It's pretty disappointing to see such a drop in overall quality. What good is having high burn time in a large jar when you pretty much smell nothing 80% of the time it's lit?

"Yankee Candle Pineapple Cilantro Jar Candle, Large Jar",B0032JHSP6,Maria Robin Estes,"I ordered 2 of these candles which were sold by the same company. They were shipped and arrived on different days. I‚Äôm still trying to understand why. Both candles were shipped poorly. The 1st had the top tapped as if done by an elementary student and thrown in a box. The 2nd appeared to have been taped, but somehow the top became detached and it was shipped in an envelope. What I noticed upon opening the envelope was lack of fragrance. I cleaned away the tape and decided to light the candle and burn for a couple of hours. I was extremely dissatisfied. There was a very faint fragrance and the candle began to burn straight down the center. I‚Äôve purchased this candle in the past. I know how beautiful the fragrance is or should be and these candles last for a long time. The candle that I‚Äôve been using in my bathroom was purchased in November 2019 and while I don‚Äôt burn it every day. It is still very fragrant and after a year still has quite a bit of burn time left.

If you sign up for the PAPER catalog from Yankee that STILL comes in the snail mail you'll get coupons for B.O.G.O. Free on the large jar candles.

"Yankee Candle Pineapple Cilantro Jar Candle, Large Jar",B0032JHSP6,Toby Moore,"This was purchased as a small Valentine's gift for my wife.  I had bought her a Lemon Verbena candle (different brand) for Christmas, which smelled really nice.  But then we noticed the terrible black soot it left on her home office walls and ceiling...so much for buying another.  She's had dozens of Yankee candles over the years with no issues, and this one was ""Amazon's Choice"" so I went for it.  Simply put, this jar missed the fragrance nozzle on the assembly line.  We're talking basically no lemon, unless you concentrate it in a very small location.  And even then you have to practically singe your eyebrows off leaning into it to smell anything.  Nothing like other Yankee stuff in the past.  Production mistake?  Yankee's new cost-cutting philosophy?  Who knows.  Just $17 wasted.  We'll go back to generic candles bought at the supermarket.

I also smell sweet coconut, but heavier on the pineapple. It's a perfect balance, and definitely a sweet smell, though not at all in a bad way. When I burn it, the throw is strong. I'd say a 7.5 or so, and it fills my room wonderfully. I can't recommend this one enough.

I am so grateful and happy that I found Passion-fruit Martini. This fragrant masterpiece is staying with me forever! I would rate the fragrance strength 5 out of five! The scent is somewhat similar to Coconut Guava Fusion, but is twice more fragrant, and much richer with a greater depth of sophistication and a play of under-tones in the scent. Along with Chocolate Layer Cake (love also) and Salted Caramel (not in love) , this is one of the most fragrant Yankee collection that I own.

"Yankee Candle Pineapple Cilantro Jar Candle, Large Jar",B0032JHSP6,Tirzah Price,"I'm such a fan of the fragrance! It's sweet and exotic, and so relaxing. It's not overbearing and it doesn't get too strong or sickly-sweet smelling when the candle is burning, which is an issue I have with many cheaper candles I buy. The 22 oz. jar is nice and big, and the packaging boasts over 100 hours of burn time, which I can attest to. I lit this one 2-5 hours a day for over 5 weeks before it burnt out. My only complaint would be that I still have probably a half of an inch of wax in the bottom of the jar, but my wick is completely burnt. This could be be due to the fact that I had to blow it out at one point, and if I had kept burning it, the wax would have been used up completely. Otherwise, this is a wonderful product--pineapple and cilantro aren't two scents you'd think to combine, but they're fantastic together! At $25, it's a little bit pricey for a candle, but this is a big jar and it really does last, so it's well worth the money!",5.0,2011-05-10,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0032JHSP6/?pageNumber=8

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose",B078VJPW4Z,Rachel,"As the title states, I suggest that you do not order candles while you're intoxicated. I hate patchouli so I have no idea why I ordered this candle. I think I liked the name of it and at the time I was searching for a candle to put in my bedroom. I don't think I bothered to read the description of the candle or the reviews, which I normally do, and ordered it simply because of the name and because I like other Yankee Candles. Even though the patchouli is not the main scent, the fact that I noticed it at all was enough for me to dislike it. Also the candle had some hardened bubbles on the top and was not level, like it had melted and was slightly tilted on its side and then hardened in place. Neither of those reasons would have caused me to return this item - just a heads up to anyone who doesn't like either of those things. I am returning only because the smell of this candle does not match my personal scent preferences at all. Ew.",1.0,2018-09-28,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B078VJPW4Z/?pageNumber=1

After lighting the candle I realize to my horror that the hair is embedded in the wax, so I then decide whatever I‚Äôll cut the price of hair out with a knife and the hair is really up in this candle. I ended up being able to pull the rest of the very long piece of hair out of my candle. Was it gross? Yeah. Did I still use the candle? Oh yeah it smells good.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose",B078VJPW4Z,The Machinist,"To the reviewer below: It's not Yankee Candles fault you ordered a scent u know u hate cuz your drunk & then have the audacity to give the product 1 lousy star, shameful.  With that said let me say I ordered 2 PINK SANDS scented lg . jar candles for office gifts and they were just as perfect a quality as tho bought in an actual Yankee store.  Stickers were straight, no bubbles, no hair as other reviewer tried to claim was case, filled level, wicks even. If you are wondering about the scent,  I guess I can best describe it as a sweet mix of those strawberry hard candies, with a pinch of a cotton candy ish smell somehow combined with a light beach scent swirled with suntan lotion, sandalwood laden sand anotherwords ... ABSOLUTELY DELISCIOUS and not too summery that u cant can't burn mid January.  Infact, it helps me erase a little winter depression when I burn. One VERY IMPORTANT thing to remember with these candles for longevity is #1 TRIM WICKS down to 1/8 inch and monitor length. If you are seeing black soot on glass, wicks is TOO long. Also, all good candles recommend you light for 2 to 4 hrs at a time, let cool then trim & re - light. If you do this you will have perfect results. Ps. Never burn last inch or two as glass can crack ... *tip: Scrape out last 2 inches or so with butter knife (can put cool candle in freezer for 10 min. first for less mess) and put in a tart/wax warmer or save to use in one later. It smells amazing, gives u a few tarts worth and more bang for your buck, enjoy!!",5.0,2019-12-13,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B078VJPW4Z/?pageNumber=1

I was not about to drop $40 on a replacement jar candle, nosirree, so this Yankee candle, on sale of course, fit the bill.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose",B078VJPW4Z,Rebo Quintana,"I have bought and used several of these candles in different fragrances, including: Lilac blossoms, Midnight Jasmine, Midsummer‚Äôs Night, Pink Sands, and Silver Birch. I have four dogs and one enormous great room, which includes the kitchen, dining area, entry way, living area, and the dogs‚Äô niche where their beds are. So I am always battling the smell to keep the house smelling nice. Overall, I would give this brand of candles 5 stars. Four out of the five fragrances I‚Äôve tried were pleasant smelling, had a strong odor that would fill the large room, and a long life. They were packaged very well (inside their own box) and burn evenly. Here are my ratings for the scents: Lilac: Five stars. Very strong smell. Sweet and flowery. I love lilac but it was a bit much for my taste for the main part of the house. Jasmine: Five Stars (more if I could!). Wonderful scent. Flowery but not over powering. Mellow. Lots of compliments on this one and asking where I got it, etc. Can be hard to find, too. Recommended. Midsummer‚Äôs Night. Five Stars. Pleasant, ‚Äúsoapy‚Äù smell. Reminds me of what the bathroom smells like after a shower. I loved this scent, but it is nicer for a bathroom than a main room IMO. Recommended. Pink Sands. Two Stars. Very ‚Äúpink‚Äù smelling. Reminded me of bubblegum. Scent was very weak. Could barely smell it at all. Wish I had returned it. Not recommended. Silver Birch. Five Stars. Very ‚Äúwoodsy.‚Äù Makes me think of fall/winter. Very pleasant smell for a main room. Recommended. I definitely recommend these candles overall, especially the four scenes above.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose",B078VJPW4Z,K&P Jodi,"These candles smell delicious! I will definitely be purchasing more of these. These candles also lasted a very long time as well. It was very cold outside and I had the fireplace going for two days straight since it was warmer in the living room and I decided to sleep in there. I also lighted the candle too and it burned for two days straight (not recommended). I did not blow it out once. The glass did not get too hot either. I always feel the candle glass when I burn a candle for a long length of time at once due to the fact that I have had them get too hot and break when the candle gets closer to the bottom of the wick. This candle stayed warm and did not get too hot. I was even able to light it for one more evening after I had it burning for 48 hours straight. When I lit it the 2nd time. I went ahead and let it burn down to the wick feeling the glass every now and then to make sure it wasn't getting too hot. It was fine and burned down to the wick like a good candle should do instead of burning less or half of the wax and then the wick is too short to light any longer. I promise that you will get your moneys worth with this candle. The flame is nice and bright and the smell is amazing. I ordered the Pink Sands, Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose, and the Honey Clementine. I have not burned the Honey-Clementine candle yet. It's a kitchen candle but I will burn it anywhere. All 3 candles that I had purchased were the larger 22 ounce candles. Thank you!

I had never smelled it, or even seen it in stores (I discovered upon looking into it that this is a new scent), and I thought why not? I am SO glad I went with my gut and just got it. The mix of the smells is just amazing. The apricot scent prevails over the rose for sure, which honestly surprised me! I feel like apricot is a hard smell to capture in a candle. The rose smell is also noticeable, but not over powering. It reminds me of the smell of Rosa  Double Delight roses (for those rose gurus out there) Which (for those of you who aren't gurus) is a sweet floral scent, with fruit like tones. This scent makes me feel super happy while its burning, and in my opinion is great for any time of day!

The smell is not terribly strong but also not necessarily weak, I imagine this would be a good choice for someone who likes fruity smells that aren't too overpowering. I gave this candle four stars instead of five because I was expecting a different (and admittedly stronger) smell but otherwise It is really a great candle.

This is the only one that ever made me feel ill if I left it on for more than hour in a room that is about 11 by 12 feet. I am willing to admit its possible I could have some allergy I never knew about from something they used in the candle making process. However. My very expensive coway air purifier that detects noxious smells and turns up accordingly has never been affected by any candles, even when i tried putting them literally a foot away it only turns up when I light or put them out. But this candle made it go off every time. Even then I wouldnt give them such a low star rating. Just thought it worth mentioning because people might not realize the candle is making them feel nauseous if that is the case. The reason I am writint this is because the candle was listed at beinf 35+ hours. And while I dont time it. I did not that my 10 hour candle lasted a lot longer than this thing did. Keep in mind these are mostly oppinions. Not actual facts if you want to be technical. The candle itself smelled very nice I thought. But for the price they charge, and given my experience?

Fresh Cut Roses is hands down my most favourite yankee candle scent ever! I normally buy the large jars but since the COVID stuff is going on, I couldn't afford the large jar. Next time, I will wait and spring for the large jar because this small tumbler does not do the scent justice. Even though we only place it in an average sized bathroom. The large jar that is placed in my bathroom will throw the scent in the bathroom and spew out into our entire master bedroom sized room very well and very strong! But this small tumbler barely fills just our bathroom. I assumed it would still saturate the bathroom but it did not. It was very weak. Maybe this yankee candle scent only works well in a larger jar than smaller jar. It did arrive with the wick not centered. It was a pain in the ass. We had to push the un-melted wax side down after each burn to even it out. But it still burned uneven and made more of a mess than tranquility. We contacted yankee candle directly and they did respond fast and did reimburse us, which was nice and surprising since some companies just say oh well too bad. That was the best part of this small tumbler experience. If you like yankee candle or have a favourite yankee candle scent. Get the largest jar for the best scent throw.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose",B078VJPW4Z,Reading since 9,"One of three floral scents (Rose and White Gardenia being two other favorites) I burn in my master bedroom, the combination is like being in a garden. In addition, because my bedroom is not enormous, the two each of the three scents, for a total of six large jar candles, gives off a genuine warmth, truly welcome on cold evenings. And of course the light from these candles, plus dim bedside lighting, gives a truly magical glow. I find the Yankee candles to be an unparalleled value for the length of burn time and the quality of the scent. There is no waxy smell, just pure romantic flowers. The floral scents, which I mostly favor, with the exception of the luscious black Midsummer Night's Dream, are true floral scents, almost as heady as the real blossoms themselves. When given the option, if you can afford it, always go for the large jars. By comparison, it is the best  value, giving a couple hundred plus hours of burn time. The only maintenance is trimming the wick after each burn and occasionally wiping off  the black soot from the top inch or so of the inside of the jar rim.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose",B078VJPW4Z,Cher,"This is my first time ordering a Yankee Candle. Read all the hype on this brand. Watched a couple of YouTubes; was impressed. I was juusst about to buy another brand which was going to cost me $15 for only 6 ounces (should have stuck with that choice). However, I found some Yankee Candles at a good price. Received my ""Pink Sands"" candle fast! (happy/excited) But what a BIG disappointment! Absolutely ""No scent"" from my candle? And No, I don't have Covid (lol) Usually you can smell at least a slight scent during the unboxing stage. Even when removing the lid, still no scent? That should have been a hint. However, I thought ""maybe"" I needed to burn it to smell it. Still nothing? Placed it in a small bathroom with the door closed for about 15 min, still no scent? Tested on two other people ~ same result. Is it possible I got a ""DUD""? Maybe it is old?  I don't need an expensive emergency ""power outage"" candle. What a waste of money! Unsatisfied Customer here for sure! Even though it said it was new on the listing, It ""seems"" like it was maybe a return? And I'm sure if it was, it was due to the same problem. Unfortunately, you can only return the candle in new or unused condition. All the favorite Yankee Candle scents that YouTubers put in their top/favorite lists like, ""Pomegranate Cider"" or ""Pumpkin Wreath"" are recently listed for double compared to what I paid. My candle ""Pink Sands"" was one of the lowest priced Yankee Candles I came across.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose",B078VJPW4Z,AngelinaMaria,"I can‚Äôt take a photo because it didn‚Äôt last long enough. Kind of disappointed with Yankee. This used to be my favorite, but the quality & longevity isn‚Äôt worth the price anymore. The scent is great- if you have your nose glued to the jar. Otherwise, I didn‚Äôt find it emitted much of anything (even in a tiny, studio apartment). I only had it burning for 2-3 hours on occasion, but it didn‚Äôt last more than a month. And, the wick wasn‚Äôt strong enough to keep a decent flame... started to stifle with pooling wax that also dissipated so quickly the entire thing didn‚Äôt last. I would feel bad giving this as a gift. As nice as it seems- it isn‚Äôt worth it and kind of a waste of money. Their candles used to be WAY better in scent & longevity.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose",B078VJPW4Z,Reading since 9,"One of a trio of Yankee candle floral scents I like to burn in my master bedroom. The whole room smells like a garden, almost like the fresh flowers themselves. As an added bonus, the lighting is sublime and because our room is not enormous, the candles add actual warmth, very welcome on colder days, even in Georgia, which gets its fair share of cold days in Winter. The large jars burn a long time and I don't think I have found a brand that's worth what these Yankees are. The price you pay for them is worth it because they smell so wonderful and true to what they are labeled.

They both burned slow and I could almost smell them from my living room into  the hallway but not quite and that was after burning the first one for over four hours!  That's a long time to burn in a small apartment and NOT smell it, actually considering there is no door between the living room and the hall... so no, it's not as strong as it should be but stronger than MOST Yankee candles.

Most of the time, my favorite scents are not available through the official Yankee Candle store, so I head over here to find them! This candle packs a very fresh, vibrant scent of roses - as if they are right under your nose!! The wax is of such high quality that it burns a VERY long time, but in my experience, the Large classic jars last longer than the Tumblers. I have a rotation of scents I like in my room, and this amazing one is definitely in there.",5.0,2019-01-28,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B078VJPW4Z/?pageNumber=17

Cinnamon Roll Scented Candles for Home | Non Toxic Long Lasting Soy Candles | Delicious Scent | Large 16 oz Mason Jar | Hand Made in The USA,B07WDYMGZN,Austin Lautenbach,"I rarely if ever write amazon reviews but this is likely one of my most disappointing items I've ever purchased. I recently ran out of my B&BW 20oz pumpkin candle which I loved, but I thought I'd try a smaller brand for a change. I was very disappointed for the following reasons: - the candle lacks any scent other than a faint smoke. I used it in a small 8x10 room with no external windows opened and I was unable to smell any difference at all, even from 2 feet away - the candle does not burn effectively and went out on me multiple times. I followed the lighting instructions to the T meaning cutting the wick to the correct length, cleaning out any debris, and always burning within the reccomended time limit. I still had it go out multiple times - this candle has severe tunneling issues. I think the wick might be too small for the diameter of the jar, because my candle melted out the inside only and left thick wax walls around the edges. Again, this was all while following the correct use instructions - the candle is tiny for its price. I realize it is listed as 8oz so I was expecting it to be small, but in light of the other problems listed above this seems an unacceptable price to size ratio. You can easily get 18 or 20 oz candles on this site that are better. Overall, I am disappointed and would not recommend this product to anyone.

"Yankee Candle Large 2-Wick Tumbler Candle, Spiced Pumpkin",B004USM1A0,Courtney G,"I am very disappointed in this candle.  I have been buying authentic Yankee Candles for 20+ years and I‚Äôve never had such a low quality dud. This candle had no scent and the wick burned so quickly that I had to dump out wax so the flame would stay lit.  Even after dumping out wax, the wick burned unusually fast (for a Yankee candle). I went out and bought a comparable Yankee Candle from a reputable, authorized dealer and the difference was night and day. The candle I purchased from the dealer was exactly what I was used to seeing in a real Yankee Candle.

When I picked up the box, I could hear the glass moving around. Unless I completely break off the remaining glass, I can't use this candle as is.

"Yankee Candle Large 2-Wick Tumbler Candle, Spiced Pumpkin",B004USM1A0,Kyle H,"During pretty much any time of year I'm burning candles. I've burned cheaper ones like ""American home"" or ""village candle"" and I've burned nicer one's like ""yankee"" or ""kringle"". The cheaper candles are always faster burning and less fragrant. It's worth it to get a decent candle. Unless you REALLY want a specific (usually seasonal) scent, don't pay more than around 18$ for one of these. I've seen a bunch on here for like 25$+ and at that cost you're better off ordering kringle or some ""artisan"" brand. For 18ish bucks this candle is fantastic. This specific scent has lasted longer than some others, in that everyday I light it I can still smell it despite burning it for a week. Your nose and sense of smell is logarithmic (like your other senses) and after you have been exposed to the same smell for long enough, your brain stops recognizing it as unique and potent to your environment. It helps to buy several scents and rotate between them.",5.0,2020-10-19,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B004USM1A0/?pageNumber=2

I received a candle today and was shocked when I took the top off of the candle. It had mold on the top. At first I thought it was just air bubbles, but after getting a magnifying glass out and looking at it, it is definitely mold. I called customer service and they said I may have to return it for my refund. Which means I have to take it across town to the UPS store to return it. I was sold faulty merchandise and it should not be my responsibility to take care of a bad product. Beside the mold issues, which is enough, it barely had a scent.

"Yankee Candle Large 2-Wick Tumbler Candle, Spiced Pumpkin",B004USM1A0,Karina-Oh!,"It's worth the effort to always see what Amazon Warehouse has in stock before you buy your item. I've gotten in the habit of doing this when I'm looking for a Yankee Candle. I found a Spiced Pumpkin large jar candle just a couple of days ago that was reduced to $13.39. So I decided to give it a shot. All of my past experiences have been good and this one was no exception! It arrived 1 full day early & it was very carefully packed. Upon opening, the jar was in excellent condition. Everything about the candle is authentic Yankee quality. However, when I removed the glass lid I saw that the wick was slightly singed, yet none of the wax surrounding it had been melted. Sort of like it had been lit and immediately blown out. It wasn't intended to be a gift; but if it was it wasn't giftable, so I rated it only 1 star for that category. I lit my candle and in a few seconds, no one was the wiser, lol... This candle currently costs $24.97 brand new on Amazon. I can live with the savings of $11.58, though.

But, it appears that during production the wax was old or something as there are a lot of what appears to be air bubbles through out the wax in the jar. Since its not a gift I went ahead and lit the wick. It is a faint scent, smells good, but hardly able to smell it unless I'm right up on the candle.

Fast forward a couple of weeks. Once the candle had burned down about an inch, all of the scent disappeared. I am so disappointed. I have practically a whole candle that has no aroma. I've never experienced this with a Yankee Candle before, however I've read many reviews from people who have experienced a similar issue with other scents.

"Yankee Candle Large 2-Wick Tumbler Candle, Spiced Pumpkin",B004USM1A0,Joe E.,"I have purchased many different brands of candles over the years trying to find a company that competes in its fragrances with Yankee candles. I finally decided several years ago that I would only buy Yankee candles and stop wasting my money on the other brands, since I am always disappointed with them. I was thrilled when I found my favorite Cranberry Chutney jar candle available on Amazon a couple of weeks before Christmas. However, as I have burned it over the past several days, I have been extremely disappointed. My house used to be filled with the delicious aroma from this candle, but this time, I can barely smell it. I have heard the excuse that people are complaining about Yankee candles' scents this year due to a loss of smell from Covid-19. That is not the case with me, because I have not contracted covid, and my sense of smell is just fine. If other people are complaining, I have a feeling the Yankee Candle Company has changed something in the way it adds the different fragrances to their candles, so now, they are less potent than they always have been. I want a candle that can fill my house with a delicious scent, not one that I have to keep trying to smell! If you are expecting the Yankee Candle of old when you purchase this one, you will be disappointed. Please, Yankee Candle Company, go back to your former formulas for your candles!",2.0,2021-12-31,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B004USM1A0/?pageNumber=3

"Yankee Candle Large 2-Wick Tumbler Candle, Spiced Pumpkin",B004USM1A0,Lanie,"I've been purchasing Yankee Candle products (mainly candles) for over 20 years and can say without a doubt in my mind that it doesn't matter if you purchase from an authorized dealer or from the Yankee Candle website or in a corporate store, the majority of the time you aren't going to get much of a scent release from many of their candles when they are burning.  Their quality (or scent release) is just not even close what it used to be and that's a shame because they used to be the beast of candles when it came to scent.  If you are looking for a candle that has a lot of scent to it, Yankee is not the company to look at anymore and hasn't been for a while now. That said, I also think that this candle was worth the price that I paid for it.  I grabbed two of them for less than $10 each with free shipping.  That price changed how satisfied I am with the product and did effect my review rating and satisfaction level.  Hopefully that makes sense. Autumn Wreath does smell good when it is cold and the name fits the cold scent notes very well.  It really doesn't have much scent at all when it is lit.  I've had multiples of this one from a couple of different places that I caught on deep sale or clearance and not one performed better than any of the others. I placed this candle into a Yankee jar candle holder with the illuma lid hoping that the illuma lid would help because sometimes they do.  Unfortunately the extra heat that the illuma lid provides did not increase the scent release in this candle.  It just looks really pretty in the holder sitting on my kitchen counter. I will usually burn a candle that has a strong scent over by my stove at the same time so I have the ambiance of two candles burning but the scent of only one.  In an odd way, I actually like that I can practically count on Yankee to have zero scent release when burning so I can create a nice comfy look and feel, without multiple candles having a scent war that can give me a headache.  That is now the beauty of Yankee Candle and Autumn Wreath. All in all I think this candle is today's version of a typical Yankee Candle and that's why I gave it three stars.  It's a large candle that provides ambiance and looks pretty in a jar holder.  Nothing more, nothing less.",3.0,2019-02-04,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B004USM1A0/?pageNumber=3
"Yankee Candle Large 2-Wick Tumbler Candle, Spiced Pumpkin",B004USM1A0,Weekend Coffee Guru,"I am a long time purchaser of Yankee Candles and for the most part have always been satisfied with their products.  That being said, the Autumn Wreath Candle by Yankee Candle is very disappointing.  This candle has no scent what so ever unless you count the smell given off by a typical unscented candle.  Perhaps these candles lose their scent over time and this just happens to be a very old candle at the time of my purchase.  I also had made a gift of a second Autumn Wreath candle to a close friend and she also stated that her candle had no scent either.  At the same time I purchased a second scented Yankee Candle this one being Balsam & Cedar and am quite happy with that purchase.  Could it be just a bad batch of Autumn Wreath Candles?

The worst of the bunch was my latest, a two-wick tumbler in ""Crisp Fall Night"". After the 6 prior candles I bought with 6 bad wicks, I waited for a year before I bought this newest candle.  I see it's still the same.  The Crisp Fall Night candle didn't make it past 1.5 hours until the wicks were burned right to the wax level.  I don't have this problem with any other brand.

I also purchased one for my stepdad and he uses it all the time - and it‚Äôs still very full, so he‚Äôll get a lot more use out of it. I love Yankee Candles because they tend to last a super long time, so they may be more pricey sometimes but it‚Äôs worth the money.

Plus I got a great deal ($10.98) However whoever packed the box ruined the candle. The candle itself was wrapped well but when the packer put the 2 candles in the Amazon box they clearly did not pay attention to the image and words saying to keep the Yankee candle box upright (listed on every side of the box) and instead put them on their side. Needless to say the candles melted in the summer heat (luckily this pumpkin one stayed mostly intact except for the melted remnants around the rim/lid). My other candle did not fare as well. This is something Amazon should monitor as this issue could‚Äôve been avoided.

TL;DR: maybe I am not a candle connoisseur, but I was really expecting that all of the wax would burn with the wick. It does not - lots of left over wax along the walls of the jar. Also, scent although nice isn't very strong (maybe a plus for some folks). --- What are you supposed to get in return? A nice relaxing scent? I suppose so - but it's not that strong. Was hoping to use this to combat kitchen odor after cooking something... fragrant, but it's barely noticeable. Also, the wick burns too quickly and doesn't draw enough wax? I was expecting the heat from the flame would melt the wax, and the wick would draw the molten wax as fuel for the flame. That way as the wick goes down, so does the wax. However, with this candle, the wick's going down but a bunch of wax remains on the sides of the jar...

Yankee has a winner here... it just smells like FALL. Jumping into piles of raked leaves, the faintest smell of leaves burning (very faint) with hints of pumpkins and spicy things. We live in the center of South Carolina, and as transplanted Yankees, we miss the 4 seasons. Spring and fall are both very brief, so we swiftly go from sweltering humid to cold and rainy with about 6 weeks in between. Don't get me wrong - South Carolina is a wonderful place to live, & as my husband says, ""You don't have to shovel rain."" He's a native of upstate New York, a veteran of a LOT of lake-effect snow... so we have Spring & Fall vicariously through Yankee candles' wonderful aromas.

I have burned this fake candle almost 2 hours to only get a faint Autumn Harvest scent by sniffing near the jar.

"Yankee Candle Large 2-Wick Tumbler Candle, Spiced Pumpkin",B004USM1A0,Josh h.,"I give this a 4 star for value for money because the burn is nice and slow, the frangrance strong, and the size big. BUT... I honestly cant stand the smell! I bought 2 different brands of Pumpkin Spice candles before this (McCalls Country Canning and The Candle Daddy) trying to find my favorite for the best price and this smell was NOTHING like any other pumpkin spice candle i have ever smelled. It's super sweet like a fake sweet, like super strong candy smell.... It literally has made me nauseous. I've let it burn for 4 hours now, hoping that it would heat up and smell better, but definitely not. Maybe this particular scent is just not for me. Also, it arrived with some oily crud stuck all the way around the inner part of the lid, not a big deal, just gross.",2.0,2018-10-24,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B004USM1A0/?pageNumber=12

I am not sure if these are just very old stock, or perhaps seconds. Normally, these fill the room with their wonderful scents. With the one I received, you can tell a candle is burning, but you'd never guess the scent (either while burning or after extinguishing it). Very different from my other YC items.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar, Christmas Cookie",B000C2TB6U,CTaylor,"I have been buying Yankee candles for 20 years. Ordered 2 Yankee candles and both came today. This particular one ""Christmas Cookie"" appears to be a fake! I'm 99% positive. The bottom of the jar doesn't have the ""normal"" Yankee candle sticker. Also it smells like a cheap vanilla sent from the dollar store. There is very little smell. You can also tell that it was poured very smoothly. Yankee candles are not smooth like that and have waxy oily fragrant bubbles in them! I have never been so disappointed. Definitely will never order from this seller again. I paid way to much money for this candle, for it to smell so cheap! I know what Christmas cookies Yankee candles smell like and this isn't it!!!

When I walk into my parent's house, I don't smell their dogs, last night's dinner, or even the coffee they have brewing.  I'm smacked in the face with a wall of this strong sugar cookie scent and it is wonderful.  The candles seem to last forever (or a few months until I buy her a new one).  They have a single wick which I personally prefer, as it increases the burn time, and the scent is really strong even with a single wick. I do agree that the rim of the candle can become coated in soot, and the candle is so large it's difficult to reach all the way in to light it without getting soot on your hand.  A BBQ lighter or long match solves both those problems.",5.0,2016-11-01,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000C2TB6U/?pageNumber=19

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Bahama Breeze,B004G9DV66,Mom of 2,Ordered 2 and one arrived glass broken. Very Very little throw. Quality has either gone down on yankee candles or these are fake. I ordered a few from the Yankee website on Cyber Monday so im going to compare. The scent is nice when you put your nose OVER it. This compared to lighting my Bath&Body candle and within 30 minutes you can smell it almost throughout a 3000 sq ft home. Village candle and Scentsationals also give good throws. By the way I also tested this and a GLADE candle a quarter of the size in 2 guest bathrooms. After 2 hours  went to check and the glade smell was more stronger and evident.,2.0,2017-11-28,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B004G9DV66/?pageNumber=1
Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Bahama Breeze,B004G9DV66,MARMich,"I am a big Yankee Candle fan. This was my first time trying Coconut Beach because I usually stick with the tried and true classics like Macintosh Apple and Sage and Citrus. The candle is very pretty and would make a nice gift. It burns evenly if you keep the wick trimmed and use a candle topper. But, this candle has absolutely no scent. At first, I thought that I didn't burn it long enough. So, the next day I burned it for over three hours. You need to stand right next to the burning candle to pick up the slightest smell. I order all my Yankee Candles from Amazon, and I have never had a problem. So, I am not sure if this is an ""old"" candle or the scent is simply very, very subtle.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Bahama Breeze,B004G9DV66,Alvar,"This candle smells good and I really like the teal-blue color of the candle too. The price was greatly on sale, so I jumped on this while I could, but full price is alright as far as candles go. Yankee Candle is my favorite candle brand though because of how good they smell and how much scent they produce, so I at least know what I'm getting for the price. This is a big candle as well, so it should last a good amount of time. The scent is about as you may expect, spruce as stated, with a crisp refreshing smell for the icy blue part that is somewhat like a men's body wash if I had to match it to something but it's not as soapy smelling. I don't know how else to describe it but I like it. Update: It was good when I first used it, but the more it's used, the more the scent is starting to smell like soap. The spruce scent is no longer present.",3.0,2019-01-27,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B004G9DV66/?pageNumber=1
Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Bahama Breeze,B004G9DV66,Keith,Inexpensive vacation just to add reason to this comment I am pretty much totally blind but at my new house I have a great back deck that is very similar to one that you would find on the condo at the beach. So I light the candle I sit down in my patio chair enjoying the breeze is and the scent of the candle if I could just get a machine to simulate wave noise I could pretend I was with a $300 a night condo at the beach. It‚Äôs just very nice it gives you the overall sensation that you‚Äôre at the beach but without having The saddle up at the front desk in the morning or the either continental breakfast :-) I think it‚Äôll add to the overall effectiveness of your house. I know a lot of hotels at the beach use similar things in the lobby to create the sensation while you‚Äôre at the beach so I‚Äôm not created in your own house wherever it may be.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Bahama Breeze,B004G9DV66,Dave,"So this is what arrived in the mail. I ordered three different candles and 2 came OK with this one being unusable. I fortunately was able to put this over low heat for an hour or so and pull the wick out and reset things, but I shouldn't have to do this! I also didn't think I should have to go through the trouble to have to send it back to get a refund or a replacement. Either way I am good now but will likely never order candles again through Amazon or purchase Yankee Candles as for the price and the trouble I went through, I would prefer a generic candle from Ross or Marshall's.",3.0,2020-12-10,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B004G9DV66/?pageNumber=2

And the wicked's even 2 in too short! The quality of this company has gone way down if this is what they're shipping to me! May want to reconsider this candle company!

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Bahama Breeze,B004G9DV66,Robyn M Romrell,"I loved this scent when I smelled it at the store and decided to buy it, so I ordered it online.  I did read the other customer reviews, saw the complaints and took my chances and ordered it anyway.  The reason?....I have other Yankee Candles with subtle smells like Clean Cotton and while it's not overly strong, if you burn it long enough, it fills your house with a wonderful smell.  So, I thought this would be the same.  It's not!  I burnt it for 4 hours and even left and came back and still couldn't smell it.  Usually when you walk in from outdoors, you can smell things better. Not the case here.  I read a response that a Yankee Candle customer service rep sent to one bad review saying that the company tries to cater to different customers, some of whom don't want strong candles.  I get that, but this should be put under the category of ""alternative light source"" rather than a candle with an aroma (which is what you expect from YC) because this candle isn't subtle, it's non existent.  I really wish the company would listen to the reviews and add more scent to this candle because it truly is a fabulous smell (if you stick your nose right in the top of the unlit candle for a sniff).  If it were stronger, it would be one of my staple candles.  I stock up on the the ones I like.  YC, please notify me if anything changes with this candle because I'll be it's number one fan.",2.0,2014-04-30,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B004G9DV66/?pageNumber=2

Yankee Candle 1218400Z Large Jar Candle Kitchen Spice,B0057I5TIS,David C.,"I usually have good experience with Yankee Candles.  But 2 of the 3 I bought on Amazon were duds.  Both Sparkling Cinnamon candles only burned about 50% of the wax before the wicks were spent.  I always trimmed the wicks per the instructions on the bottom, but one of them sooted really badly and neither burned properly. On the first, about 1.5 inches from the bottom, the wick burned out because it was folded over and didn't go to the bottom of the candle.  The other one burned with such a low flame that it burned a hole down into the wax without melting half of it.  I've never had this problem with Yankee Candles purchased at a local brick and mortar store for $20+.  Perhaps these $13 units on Amazon are factory rejects? On a positive note, they smelled good.  Just wish I would have gotten them to burn thoroughly. I don't think I'll be buying any more of these off of Amazon.",2.0,2019-01-18,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0057I5TIS/?pageNumber=1

Yankee Candle 1218400Z Large Jar Candle Kitchen Spice,B0057I5TIS,Wayne Connell,"I purchase Yankee Candles regularly, an array of different scents throughout the year. Every 8th or 9th purchase yields a candle that is so devoid of fragrance as to make dubious the claim that it is a scented candle at all. This purchase of Sparkling Cinnamon is another example. After burning it for at least two hours, it smelled like ... absolutely nothing. Even inhaling deeply near the lip of the burning candle yielded no discernible scent. Yankee Candle needs to do a better job ensuring consistency of formula and product design. It is frustrating to pay $27 for a ""scented"" candle that is, in fact, unscented.",1.0,2016-09-18,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0057I5TIS/?pageNumber=1

Yankee Candle 1218400Z Large Jar Candle Kitchen Spice,B0057I5TIS,Renee,"I've been a Yankee Candle addict for well over 15 years, and this scent, ""Home Sweet Home,"" is the only one I use year-round! This purchase was delivered a day early and is a REAL Yankee Candle, not fake (believe me, I would know immediately if they were). People have asked me why I always buy the Yankee Candle brand? Because they're more expensive than others. I explain to them that I have bought other ""knockoffs"" to save money before, only to end up getting exactly what I paid for...wasted wax without any scent at the last 1/3 to 1/4 of the jar üòí, so they didn't save me anything. I don't work for the company, but I am a stickler for being well informed, so I know why the Yankee Candles cost more than their competitors... See, other companies only use their scented wax at the top 3/4 or 1/2 of their candle products, the bottom is just colored wax with a hint of scent. This way, they are able to trick the average customer into buying them. Don't get me wrong, at first, they all have great ""throw,"" however, as they burn down, their scent becomes much weaker. Some brands don't even use wicks long enough for their candles, causing them to fizzle out long before they should. Yankee Candle Company uses fully scented wax throughout the entire candle. They also have a high concentration of scented oils, to insure a strong throw of scent, from the first time you light it until it burns all the way down. *** P. S. Make sure you buy the REAL THING, not a cheap knockoff. I noticed that the complaints here are all about the ""Cinnamon Sparkle"" scent. Even though they're listed under the ""Home Sweet Home"" one. I ordered 2 of the ""Home Sweet Home"" scent here, and they're real Yankee Candle brand. If you get a fake one, like some of the other customers, report it to Amazon immediately! Amazon is just a distributor. They'll accept a return, even if your candle is burned to the wick, refund your money, then investigate to persecute the dirty posers!***",5.0,2021-07-02,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0057I5TIS/?pageNumber=2
Yankee Candle 1218400Z Large Jar Candle Kitchen Spice,B0057I5TIS,Just sayin'..,"I have had this scent for almost 20 years, give it take. The last one I had was bought about 5ish years ago and cycled seasonly with other Yankee Candles. It definitely always had a cinnamon smell but not like this. This one is almost satirical! This Home Sweet Home candle has such an exaggerated cinnamon smell, it burns the throat to smell it! You'll notice I made a point to let it be known I haven't bought a HSH Yankee candle in about 5 years. I did that incase Yankee has changed the formula to increase the Cinnamon. Or maybe it was a mistake buying on Amazon? Maybe it's a second? Or maybe I am just getting old and my olfactory glands are 'going' first? The only problem with the latter is the previous HSH candle I had was at it's wicks end and I was able to compare. So if it's my olfactory senses, they went haywire overnight. Yankee offers candles with Cinnamon in the name to let it be known cinnamon is what you're going to get. Wow, if they are more 'cinnamony' than this, it would double as a tear gas agent. Just imagine putting a Yankee cinnamon candle on a warmer during the holidays. One could clear out any family or friend visitors from sheer discomfort alone! This HSH is more than half way there. One could use this to politely clear any guests out of the home. It's just too much!",2.0,2021-12-19,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0057I5TIS/?pageNumber=2

Yankee Candle 1218400Z Large Jar Candle Kitchen Spice,B0057I5TIS,Big Daddy and Babs,"First let me say that my wife and I are Yankee Candle lovers. It is the only brand of candles we purchase. Over the course of many years we have only had a few issues with their products. This was the first time we purchased the Sparkling Cinnamon scented candles which we wanted for the holidays and in regards to this variety they did not throw much scent at all, about halfway burned it started throwing a great deal of soot which was all over our coffee table and ,because of the double wicks, the candles burned twice as fast. This is a trick with every candle maker. The more wicks, the faster they burn and the more often you have to buy new candles. Please keep this in mind when buying candles. I would not recommend purchasing this particular holiday scent, but they have a great many of other high quality candles that we love. Our favorite is the single wick large pillar Midsummer Night scented candles. They give off a great deal of scent, that fragrance is wonderful (in our opinion-of course) and they last a month or more of daily use.",2.0,2020-01-29,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0057I5TIS/?pageNumber=2

Yankee Candle 1218400Z Large Jar Candle Kitchen Spice,B0057I5TIS,Kindle Customer,Very disappointed. I don't buy many Yankee candles because they are too expensive for my budget. I splurged on this one since it is Christmas season. I love the Christmas smell of balsam and the spicy scent of cloves. This candle has very little scent (had scent the first time I burned it but that has faded out) and what it has smells more like baby powder. Absolutely no clove scent at all and no balsam scent either. I paid almost $30 for this candle and it will it in the closet because it's pretty worthless as to making the house smell nice.,1.0,2021-12-14,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0057I5TIS/?pageNumber=4

Paraffin wax is made using ""petroleum, coal, or oil shale,"" yuck! So although I like the smell, I'd really rather not fill my lungs with the burning fumes from ""petroleum, coal, or oil shale"" products.

The color is wonderful too. I find Yankee Candles to be the very best and I have several of them now. This one is among my very favorites. Another fave is the sage & citrus. This is very different from that scent though so I can decide upon mood. I would highly recommend this candle if you are looking for something softly sweet and fruity scent.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Mango Peach Salsa,B001PAPPKY,Maria Robin Estes,"I ordered 2 of these candles which were sold by the same company. They were shipped and arrived on different days. I‚Äôm still trying to understand why. Both candles were shipped poorly. The 1st had the top tapped as if done by an elementary student and thrown in a box. The 2nd appeared to have been taped, but somehow the top became detached and it was shipped in an envelope. What I noticed upon opening the envelope was lack of fragrance. I cleaned away the tape and decided to light the candle and burn for a couple of hours. I was extremely dissatisfied. There was a very faint fragrance and the candle began to burn straight down the center. I‚Äôve purchased this candle in the past. I know how beautiful the fragrance is or should be and these candles last for a long time. The candle that I‚Äôve been using in my bathroom was purchased in November 2019 and while I don‚Äôt burn it every day. It is still very fragrant and after a year still has quite a bit of burn time left.

This was not it at all.  It's not bad, but it is a bit muted. You don't really smell cilantro, but I also don't quite get a pineapple scent.  It smells like a stronger version of a glade candle, to be honest.  It is not a bad scent, but it is not something one expects from Yankee.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Mango Peach Salsa,B001PAPPKY,Toby Moore,"This was purchased as a small Valentine's gift for my wife.  I had bought her a Lemon Verbena candle (different brand) for Christmas, which smelled really nice.  But then we noticed the terrible black soot it left on her home office walls and ceiling...so much for buying another.  She's had dozens of Yankee candles over the years with no issues, and this one was ""Amazon's Choice"" so I went for it.  Simply put, this jar missed the fragrance nozzle on the assembly line.  We're talking basically no lemon, unless you concentrate it in a very small location.  And even then you have to practically singe your eyebrows off leaning into it to smell anything.  Nothing like other Yankee stuff in the past.  Production mistake?  Yankee's new cost-cutting philosophy?  Who knows.  Just $17 wasted.  We'll go back to generic candles bought at the supermarket.

I don‚Äôt want to say the scent is ‚Äúoverpowering‚Äù as that word has a negative connotation.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Mango Peach Salsa,B001PAPPKY,5(me)ly,"If this has anything to do with cilantro, the only thing to even closely resemble cilantro would be the color of the candle. This was the only thing I could think of. The scent of this candle is ok, but not my favorite. If you like Hawaiian or Carribean types of scents, you would appreciate this candle a lot. I however don't, and got this candle only out of the ""cilantro"" curiosity which I don't understand what is doing on the label at all. The scent is pleasant and I will burn it since it is very enjoyable, it is somewhat ""thick"", sweet, tropical with a lot of pineapple to it. Reminds me of my Oahu vacation :) The scent is pretty prominent, not the most fragrant of other Yankees that I have, but I would rate it as medium on the fragrant scale. A good choice for someone who gets headaches from strong overwhelming scents. As other Yankees this lasts forever, I have used it quiet a few times now, and it is almost full (see the picture).

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Mango Peach Salsa,B001PAPPKY,Babs,"I love the aroma of pineapple, so when I had my bathroom re-done and the wood cabinets didn't have a pleasing aroma, I put this candle in one of them. It has been more than a year, and when I open the cabinet doors, the delicious smelling pineapple wafts throughout my entire bathroom. I had an older Yankee Candle with the same aroma and had put it in an even stronger smelling new cabinet, and it is still working. I don't know why they put ""cilantro"" smell on there, because there isn't a trace of the odor of cilantro (even though I love that scent, too). It's the fresh pineapple aroma, though, that makes my whole bathroom so pleasant.",5.0,2021-08-30,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B001PAPPKY/?pageNumber=3
Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Mango Peach Salsa,B001PAPPKY,EricaSim,"This candle is one of, if not my absolute favorite Yankee scent. Don't be fooled by the ""cilantro"" in the title. I don't smell any cilantro, unless it's the fresh aspect I smell with the candle. What I do smell when I burn it, is a smell identical to the smell I experience when I cut up a fresh, ripe, very sweet pineapple. That scent is very predominant in this candle. I also smell sweet coconut, but heavier on the pineapple. It's a perfect balance, and definitely a sweet smell, though not at all in a bad way. When I burn it, the throw is strong. I'd say a 7.5 or so, and it fills my room wonderfully. I can't recommend this one enough. Although I give the scent and throw 5 stars, I only allowed 4 stars for value, as this candle can be found for cheaper during one of Yankee's sale events, or at various discount retailers.",5.0,2018-09-28,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B001PAPPKY/?pageNumber=3

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Mango Peach Salsa,B001PAPPKY,J. E. Doyle Jr.,"The candle burned better than some more recent Yankee Candles burning cleanly and leaving no wax residue on the sides. I did trim the wick at each Re-lighting however, as is good practice for a clean burning candle. The scent was disappointing providing relatively little lemon smell beyond the immediate location where it was burned, the kitchen, unlike some Yankee Candles I have purchased in the past. The longevity of this candle was good, lasting as long as was anticipated. This would make an ok gift, but better to buy one that you know is going to smell great as well as give a good lasting performance.",4.0,2021-04-27,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B001PAPPKY/?pageNumber=3

The scent is only slightly apparent when you smell right above the candle. There are candles that are too strong, some that are just right, and this one that is a waste of money if you are buying for the scent. In most respects it performs like an unscented candle.

I opened the lid, and it was overwhelming.  I like a nice, strong scent but this was over the top!

This one is a little different. While it burns nicely with the two wicks, the smell of Honey and Clementine aren't really there. After burning in for three to five hours I can tell its more of a perfume type of smell over a natural citrus. It doesn't have a very good throw either as you need to be right up on it. Great candle but I'll try a different option for Orange/Citrus. Update- After burning for approximately 15- 20 hours it has gotten better. Better throw and scent.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Mango Peach Salsa,B001PAPPKY,Purpledog,"Smelled great out of the box: until I lit it. 3 hours of burn time, nice pool of warm wax and I can't smell a thing: not even when I put my nose to the flame (ok, almost!). It smelled amazing when I removed the lid and I couldn't wait to light it. Dreary, drizzly, damp October in New England and this would have made the day a lot more cheery. Right now, 3+ hours of burn time, and it is pretty much just a red, unscented jar candle. I'll keep it for power outages but as far as scenting the house, I suggest Red Apple Wreath - soft apples and cloves (I think. It is definitely not cinnamon - so I'm thinking cloves). The throw on that once isn't terrific, but compared to old Macintosh which has zero throw and zero scent once lit, it will do on this dreary day.",1.0,2018-10-08,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B001PAPPKY/?pageNumber=4

It's not overbearing and it doesn't get too strong or sickly-sweet smelling when the candle is burning, which is an issue I have with many cheaper candles I buy. The 22 oz. jar is nice and big, and the packaging boasts over 100 hours of burn time, which I can attest to. I lit this one 2-5 hours a day for over 5 weeks before it burnt out. My only complaint would be that I still have probably a half of an inch of wax in the bottom of the jar, but my wick is completely burnt. This could be be due to the fact that I had to blow it out at one point, and if I had kept burning it, the wax would have been used up completely. Otherwise, this is a wonderful product--pineapple and cilantro aren't two scents you'd think to combine, but they're fantastic together!

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Mango Peach Salsa,B001PAPPKY,tracy,I love the smell of this lemon candle. The price was great so I ordered 3 of them. I have ordered 1 at a time previously. when they arrived used the 1st one right away for the holidays. When I finally got around to opening the next one was surprised that it was NOT lemon but french vanilla as was the last one as well. It would have been 5 stars if I had gotten all Lemon like ordered. I didn't send them back as it is a pain to have to mess with that during the holidays I just used them as gifts instead. I will order again but only 1 at a time so as not to be disappointed again.,3.0,2022-01-21,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B001PAPPKY/?pageNumber=8

Never again will I do this because now I have grey walls from the black smoke from the candles.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Pink Sands,B004G9C0SQ,Rachel,"As the title states, I suggest that you do not order candles while you're intoxicated. I hate patchouli so I have no idea why I ordered this candle. I think I liked the name of it and at the time I was searching for a candle to put in my bedroom. I don't think I bothered to read the description of the candle or the reviews, which I normally do, and ordered it simply because of the name and because I like other Yankee Candles. Even though the patchouli is not the main scent, the fact that I noticed it at all was enough for me to dislike it. Also the candle had some hardened bubbles on the top and was not level, like it had melted and was slightly tilted on its side and then hardened in place. Neither of those reasons would have caused me to return this item - just a heads up to anyone who doesn't like either of those things.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Pink Sands,B004G9C0SQ,The Machinist,"To the reviewer below: It's not Yankee Candles fault you ordered a scent u know u hate cuz your drunk & then have the audacity to give the product 1 lousy star, shameful.  With that said let me say I ordered 2 PINK SANDS scented lg . jar candles for office gifts and they were just as perfect a quality as tho bought in an actual Yankee store.  Stickers were straight, no bubbles, no hair as other reviewer tried to claim was case, filled level, wicks even. If you are wondering about the scent,  I guess I can best describe it as a sweet mix of those strawberry hard candies, with a pinch of a cotton candy ish smell somehow combined with a light beach scent swirled with suntan lotion, sandalwood laden sand anotherwords ... ABSOLUTELY DELISCIOUS and not too summery that u cant can't burn mid January.  Infact, it helps me erase a little winter depression when I burn. One VERY IMPORTANT thing to remember with these candles for longevity is #1 TRIM WICKS down to 1/8 inch and monitor length. If you are seeing black soot on glass, wicks is TOO long. Also, all good candles recommend you light for 2 to 4 hrs at a time, let cool then trim & re - light. If you do this you will have perfect results. Ps. Never burn last inch or two as glass can crack ... *tip: Scrape out last 2 inches or so with butter knife (can put cool candle in freezer for 10 min. first for less mess) and put in a tart/wax warmer or save to use in one later. It smells amazing, gives u a few tarts worth and more bang for your buck, enjoy!!",5.0,2019-12-13,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B004G9C0SQ/?pageNumber=1
Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Pink Sands,B004G9C0SQ,Ashley Coffey,"Full disclosure: I am a Yankee candle devotee. My usual scent of choice is Kitchen Spice, but I ventured out for this one to replace a very expensive Volcano candle someone gifted me for luxurious baths. I was not about to drop $40 on a replacement jar candle, nosirree, so this Yankee candle, on sale of course, fit the bill. The scent is refreshing and sweet, but not too overwhelming, and it reminds me of strolling on the beaches of Hawaii, i.e. heaven.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Pink Sands,B004G9C0SQ,Rebo Quintana,"I have bought and used several of these candles in different fragrances, including: Lilac blossoms, Midnight Jasmine, Midsummer‚Äôs Night, Pink Sands, and Silver Birch. I have four dogs and one enormous great room, which includes the kitchen, dining area, entry way, living area, and the dogs‚Äô niche where their beds are. So I am always battling the smell to keep the house smelling nice. Overall, I would give this brand of candles 5 stars. Four out of the five fragrances I‚Äôve tried were pleasant smelling, had a strong odor that would fill the large room, and a long life. They were packaged very well (inside their own box) and burn evenly. Here are my ratings for the scents: Lilac: Five stars. Very strong smell. Sweet and flowery. I love lilac but it was a bit much for my taste for the main part of the house. Jasmine: Five Stars (more if I could!). Wonderful scent. Flowery but not over powering. Mellow. Lots of compliments on this one and asking where I got it, etc. Can be hard to find, too. Recommended. Midsummer‚Äôs Night. Five Stars. Pleasant, ‚Äúsoapy‚Äù smell. Reminds me of what the bathroom smells like after a shower. I loved this scent, but it is nicer for a bathroom than a main room IMO. Recommended. Pink Sands. Two Stars. Very ‚Äúpink‚Äù smelling. Reminded me of bubblegum. Scent was very weak. Could barely smell it at all. Wish I had returned it. Not recommended. Silver Birch. Five Stars. Very ‚Äúwoodsy.‚Äù Makes me think of fall/winter. Very pleasant smell for a main room. Recommended. I definitely recommend these candles overall, especially the four scenes above.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Pink Sands,B004G9C0SQ,K&P Jodi,"These candles smell delicious! I will definitely be purchasing more of these. These candles also lasted a very long time as well. It was very cold outside and I had the fireplace going for two days straight since it was warmer in the living room and I decided to sleep in there. I also lighted the candle too and it burned for two days straight (not recommended). I did not blow it out once. The glass did not get too hot either. I always feel the candle glass when I burn a candle for a long length of time at once due to the fact that I have had them get too hot and break when the candle gets closer to the bottom of the wick. This candle stayed warm and did not get too hot. I was even able to light it for one more evening after I had it burning for 48 hours straight. When I lit it the 2nd time. I went ahead and let it burn down to the wick feeling the glass every now and then to make sure it wasn't getting too hot. It was fine and burned down to the wick like a good candle should do instead of burning less or half of the wax and then the wick is too short to light any longer. I promise that you will get your moneys worth with this candle. The flame is nice and bright and the smell is amazing. I ordered the Pink Sands, Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose, and the Honey Clementine. I have not burned the Honey-Clementine candle yet. It's a kitchen candle but I will burn it anywhere. All 3 candles that I had purchased were the larger 22 ounce candles. Thank you!

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Pink Sands,B004G9C0SQ,lain,"I went out on a whim in getting this one. I had never smelled it, or even seen it in stores (I discovered upon looking into it that this is a new scent), and I thought why not? I am SO glad I went with my gut and just got it. The mix of the smells is just amazing. The apricot scent prevails over the rose for sure, which honestly surprised me! I feel like apricot is a hard smell to capture in a candle. The rose smell is also noticeable, but not over powering. It reminds me of the smell of Rosa  Double Delight roses (for those rose gurus out there) Which (for those of you who aren't gurus) is a sweet floral scent, with fruit like tones. This scent makes me feel super happy while its burning, and in my opinion is great for any time of day!

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Pink Sands,B004G9C0SQ,aspring,"I bought the pink sands scent - it literally smells like starburst candy, kindof like the strawberry and watermelon flavors mixed together - definitely a very unique and pleasant scent. The smell is not terribly strong but also not necessarily weak, I imagine this would be a good choice for someone who likes fruity smells that aren't too overpowering. I gave this candle four stars instead of five because I was expecting a different (and admittedly stronger) smell but otherwise It is really a great candle. Just remember to always trim the wick before using it again because the wick starts to form black bulbs that fall off if you have the candle on after a while and you don't want these falling into the wax.",4.0,2021-02-20,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B004G9C0SQ/?pageNumber=2

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Pink Sands,B004G9C0SQ,Nekomancer,"I have been using candles for years. This is the only one that ever made me feel ill if I left it on for more than hour in a room that is about 11 by 12 feet. I am willing to admit its possible I could have some allergy I never knew about from something they used in the candle making process. However. My very expensive coway air purifier that detects noxious smells and turns up accordingly has never been affected by any candles, even when i tried putting them literally a foot away it only turns up when I light or put them out. But this candle made it go off every time. Even then I wouldnt give them such a low star rating. Just thought it worth mentioning because people might not realize the candle is making them feel nauseous if that is the case. The reason I am writint this is because the candle was listed at beinf 35+ hours. And while I dont time it. I did not that my 10 hour candle lasted a lot longer than this thing did. Keep in mind these are mostly oppinions. Not actual facts if you want to be technical. The candle itself smelled very nice I thought. But for the price they charge, and given my experience? I can say I personally will never even bother buying such an overhyped object that basically amounts to a some wax, an essential oil and a wick.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Pink Sands,B004G9C0SQ,AmazonAddict,"This is an honest non paid for non free item given review. Fresh Cut Roses is hands down my most favourite yankee candle scent ever! I normally buy the large jars but since the COVID stuff is going on, I couldn't afford the large jar. Next time, I will wait and spring for the large jar because this small tumbler does not do the scent justice. Even though we only place it in an average sized bathroom. The large jar that is placed in my bathroom will throw the scent in the bathroom and spew out into our entire master bedroom sized room very well and very strong! But this small tumbler barely fills just our bathroom. I assumed it would still saturate the bathroom but it did not. It was very weak. Maybe this yankee candle scent only works well in a larger jar than smaller jar. It did arrive with the wick not centered. It was a pain in the ass. We had to push the un-melted wax side down after each burn to even it out. But it still burned uneven and made more of a mess than tranquility. We contacted yankee candle directly and they did respond fast and did reimburse us, which was nice and surprising since some companies just say oh well too bad. That was the best part of this small tumbler experience. If you like yankee candle or have a favourite yankee candle scent. Get the largest jar for the best scent throw. This small tumbler just doesn't measure up to the large jar.",3.0,2020-04-23,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B004G9C0SQ/?pageNumber=3
Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Pink Sands,B004G9C0SQ,BGirl,"Love Yankee candles so bought this one based on reviews. Needed some scented candles for a house being sold (recently renovated and strong paint smells, not very homely) for prior to public inspections. Tried a variety of scented candles but this one was the best by far! Such a delicious scent I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äòwaste‚Äô it on open houses, I want it for myself! So I‚Äôm back to buy more. It‚Äôs a sweet scent, but also floral. It carried right through the top floor of the house (three bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a hallway). It‚Äôs a delicate apricot scent with a stronger scent of a rich summer rose. I also bought a Gardenia Yankee Candle and that has a much more delicate and floral scent (still with that heady richness of gardenia, but subtler than this one). If you don‚Äôt like sweet scents this may not be ideal for you, but if you want a powerful candle with a great throw, this one will be a great choice. Came well packaged, arrived quickly and smells great straight out of the box. Burns well, although a little lack smoke from the flame.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Pink Sands,B004G9C0SQ,Reading since 9,"One of three floral scents (Rose and White Gardenia being two other favorites) I burn in my master bedroom, the combination is like being in a garden. In addition, because my bedroom is not enormous, the two each of the three scents, for a total of six large jar candles, gives off a genuine warmth, truly welcome on cold evenings. And of course the light from these candles, plus dim bedside lighting, gives a truly magical glow. I find the Yankee candles to be an unparalleled value for the length of burn time and the quality of the scent. There is no waxy smell, just pure romantic flowers. The floral scents, which I mostly favor, with the exception of the luscious black Midsummer Night's Dream, are true floral scents, almost as heady as the real blossoms themselves. When given the option, if you can afford it, always go for the large jars. By comparison, it is the best  value, giving a couple hundred plus hours of burn time. The only maintenance is trimming the wick after each burn and occasionally wiping off  the black soot from the top inch or so of the inside of the jar rim.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Pink Sands,B004G9C0SQ,Cher,"This is my first time ordering a Yankee Candle. Read all the hype on this brand. Watched a couple of YouTubes; was impressed. I was juusst about to buy another brand which was going to cost me $15 for only 6 ounces (should have stuck with that choice). However, I found some Yankee Candles at a good price. Received my ""Pink Sands"" candle fast! (happy/excited) But what a BIG disappointment! Absolutely ""No scent"" from my candle? And No, I don't have Covid (lol) Usually you can smell at least a slight scent during the unboxing stage. Even when removing the lid, still no scent? That should have been a hint. However, I thought ""maybe"" I needed to burn it to smell it. Still nothing? Placed it in a small bathroom with the door closed for about 15 min, still no scent? Tested on two other people ~ same result. Is it possible I got a ""DUD""? Maybe it is old?  I don't need an expensive emergency ""power outage"" candle. What a waste of money! Unsatisfied Customer here for sure! Even though it said it was new on the listing, It ""seems"" like it was maybe a return? And I'm sure if it was, it was due to the same problem. Unfortunately, you can only return the candle in new or unused condition. All the favorite Yankee Candle scents that YouTubers put in their top/favorite lists like, ""Pomegranate Cider"" or ""Pumpkin Wreath"" are recently listed for double compared to what I paid. My candle ""Pink Sands"" was one of the lowest priced Yankee Candles I came across.

And, the wick wasn‚Äôt strong enough to keep a decent flame... started to stifle with pooling wax that also dissipated so quickly the entire thing didn‚Äôt last. I would feel bad giving this as a gift. As nice as it seems- it isn‚Äôt worth it and kind of a waste of money. Their candles used to be WAY better in scent & longevity.

This one does not burn like any YANKEE candle we have ever had and even the wick looks different, it is a lump of black, not the normal looking wick seen in all the other candles.

I could smell the familiar scent (I've purchased several candles in the scent over time, but not recently) when about 2"" from the flame, but that was it. As I've written in other reviews, Yankee Candles have lost their scent over the last few years. I've tried to give them up but am doing so kickn' and scream'n. Have tried other brands. Can smell them, thankfully, but they don't have the nice burn of a good ole Yankee Candle. Don't know why YC is reducing the fragrance like this.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Pink Sands,B004G9C0SQ,J,"Love Yankee candles. Fresh cut roses is one of my fav scents and is quite strong compared to others IMO.  It still has more potent scent than most do by comparison since Yankee has cut back so severely but is still no as strong as it was when it first came out. However, this last order was very pleasant, I must say. They both burned slow and I could almost smell them from my living room into  the hallway but not quite and that was after burning the first one for over four hours!  That's a long time to burn in a small apartment and NOT smell it, actually considering there is no door between the living room and the hall... so no, it's not as strong as it should be but stronger than MOST Yankee candles. Pretty much all Yankee candles just don't cut it these days but I do love this scent and as long as I was sitting in the living room on the sofa I LOVEd this scent and really enjoyed it.  As long and I get them on sale, I'm ok with them. I just don't expect much and I don't get too disappointed.  :-O",5.0,2020-02-24,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B004G9C0SQ/?pageNumber=6

In the spring and fall she has 200 gardenia blooms typically scenting the air, but what about the rest of the year? To give her year-round gardenia scent, I bought her this for her birthday (January 24) and she just called and says she's sitting in her bedroom, reading a book with dog in lap, with this gardenia scented candle lit--the fragrance is suffusing the whole room. She says it's a light, soft fragrant scent, not heavy and overpowering.  She has thanked me several times for this gift--seems to have the candle lit at all times of the day and night.  It offers 100-150 hours of fragrance.  I'm going to buy one for myself for Valentines Day in lilac--she's convinced me.

Both of my jars cakes with weird bubbles in them, which would make the aesthetics a little less appealing when gift giving.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Red Apple Wreath",B001U40C6W,Coloratura Kiki,"I like candles, especially on dark winter evenings, and even in Southern California, it gets chilly in the evenings, and of course our winter nights are long. I bought two of these large candles: Balsam and Cedar and Red Apple Wreath. (Wish I'd gotten Christmas Cookie.) To me, the Balsam and Cedar is the stronger smelling, but it smells a little more like soap than like a forest or a Christmas tree! The Red Apple Wreath has a lovely scent, but it would have been nice if the scent were a little stronger. The candles do last quite a long time, and thankfully, they burn clean. No nasty dark marks on ceilings or walls. That is a very important point to me. I like the containers, but these candles are so large that you really need a barbecue lighter to light them once they burn down low. Overall, very nice candles that would have been perfect five stars had the scent been up to par, but it just wasn't. This is especially true of my favorite of the two, the Red Apple Wreath. It's so difficult to find a really good scented candle today, and, sadly, these don't really rise to the occasion. Almost, but not quite. I will definitely use them, but I'm disappointed in the lack of a stronger scent.",4.0,2020-12-21,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B001U40C6W/?pageNumber=1

My best friend and fishing buddy was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I live in a beautiful area of the forest in northern California. He and his wife would come up often in his final years. I would light candles in their guest room before they arrived and they always commented on how nice it was to walk into the room with that smell.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Red Apple Wreath",B001U40C6W,bettygarcia,"I have been burning Yankee candles for years.  There is something wrong with this Red Apple Wreath candle.  From day one, it sputtered and sizzled when I tried to light the wick; like there is water in the candle.  I persisted, because I do like the smell, but it hasn't gotten better.  Oftentimes the candle puts itself out. leaving an unpleasant smoke pervading the air.  When I trim the wick, necessary to prevent black smoke when it gets too long, it starts up with the sputtering again when I try to light it.  I've tried putting the candle under a warmer to melt the wax, to pour out some of the wax, to elongate the wick.  This has been a fruitless process.  I've ended up pouring half of the candle out, trying to get it to burn properly.  At this point, the wick is too long.  Black smoke pours off of it when lit.  I'm afraid to trim it anymore, in fear that I'll have to pour out even more of what little is left of the wax.  I am very disappointed in this candle.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Red Apple Wreath",B001U40C6W,Eusebius,"I like most all of the 22-ounce candles from Yankee Candle, but I don't really love this one. Even though the scent is somewhat reminiscent of apples and cinnamon, to me it smells a little too artificial.  When I first lit it and later came back into the room I couldn't recognize the scent and couldn't connect it with the candle.  Maybe it's the walnut and maple that throws it off, but either way, it's not my favorite. I like it, but not as much as the other Yankee Candle fragrances. As I wrote in another review, we've tried different brands of fragrance candles and none of them even come close to the Yankee Candles. They are long lasting and fragrant - the scent is even and continuous right down to the bottom of the candle. Other cheaper brands don't last ¬º the time or have ¬º the scent and actually turn out to be more expensive than a Yankee Candle because of this.",3.0,2015-02-22,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B001U40C6W/?pageNumber=26

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Sage & Citrus,B000P6THK8,Kathie Lee,"This has been my favorite candle for many many years... Unfortunately... I would say that Yankee Candle has gone cheap... as the smell is not as strong as it used to be, nor does the smell last as long... After one use, there was little to no smell in one room.  I remember being able to burn the candle in one room and the sent was perfect and nice throughout the house.  Very disappointing.  I like Kringle Candle much better.  Yankee Candle's quality diminished after the company was sold.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Sage & Citrus,B000P6THK8,Mellie,"This candle (Midsummer Night) used to be one of the strongest scented (if not THE strongest) made by Yankee Candle. As I have written in many reviews on Amazon, and YC too, Yankee Candles have practically lost their scent. Almost 20 years ago, I saw these candles in a gift shop, and bought my first one (Ocean Water), and I was hooked. I actually became a crazy candle lady. Well over time, YCs became less and less scented (and no, it's not my nose, I've ruled that out). So I stopped buying them, though I went kicking and screaming. I now buy other brands that have stronger scents, but I miss the nice burn quality of YCs. Anyway, I bought this candle on impulse, thinking it just MIGHT still have some scent throw, since it used to be such a strong scent.  I burned it for the first time yesterday evening, for the recommended four hours for the large-jar style, and only got hints of the scent. It is the same one from days of yore but is greatly reduced in strength. I'm going to burn it again later today and decide if I can smell it enough to keep it. I hope I can decide to. And it really does have that good, consistent burn--no tunneling, soot, or anything like that. But what's up with the loss of scent, Yankee Candle? (I called the company one time, and they just blew me off). Update: I'm keeping this candle. I really enjoy it and its nice, consistent burn. I can smell it, but the scent is indeed greatly reduced compared to in the past. This is still probably one of the stronger scents offered by Yankee Candle, though most of them, these days, have practically any detectable fragrance.",3.0,2019-07-01,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000P6THK8/?pageNumber=1

I can't smell this dang thing. I even purchased it 3 times to make sure I just didnt get a dud. Maybe the lid stored ajar or something. No sir. No smell. It turned into a half bath candle for chili night. I wouldn't even trust it to scent a whole bathroom. If you want a close scent with much more throw, look towards Goose Creek's Soft Linen Breeze or Kringle's Warm Cotton. Both are better money spent.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Sage & Citrus,B000P6THK8,Amazon Customer,"First I wanna start by saying this is the best candle I've ever smelt in my life so far. I used to steal my mom's midsummer night candle when I was younger and I've just recently gotten into using candles every day. It helps with my depression, anxiety, ADHD, and ocd. They're just something simple that helps wake me up in the morning and calm my mind at night. I purchased this online because shopping with my 1 yr old gives me panic attacks when I don't have my fiance or mom with me. I was very happy to receive my shipment next day for no charge and it came in tact. It's a GORGEOUS yet simple addition for my collection. I was disappointed in the amount of cardboard that was used in the package. There were 3 boxes. And I can't recycle where I live so I try to not bring non reusable boxes into the house. Still 5 stars because despite my disappointment in the amount of cardboard used, it's still absolutely perfect.

I went on Amazon and read the reviews. I noticed most people said the candle had a very faint smell and the scent wasn't as strong as it used to be. I was hoping the company had read the reviews and it had improved the scent. Unfortunately, this is not the case. My candle arrived yesterday. I had high hopes for this candle. This was my first time purchasing a Yankee Candle and I was looking forward to enjoying this scent in my home. I was sadly mistaken. This candle do not have a scent. I literally have to lean over the candle and even then I can barely smell anything. The scent fades so quickly that even when the candle is burning, you still can not hardly smell it. I paid $18.00 for this candle which more than I have ever paid for a candle before. I get stronger scented candles from the Dollar Tree that smell better than this one.

I lit it for 15 minutes and can barely smell it, I have to have it right near my hand as I'm typing on my laptop to even smell it as much as I'd like to. The smell is fantastic, once again, but it does not spread throughout the room very much, it either has to be near my hand or I have to literally pick it up to smell it well.

Until now, I had always bought the chunky, tumbler glass ""lid. "" I decided to try this lid because the candle looked sleeker .  Anyways,..... when I went to burn it, it had NO  scent.  I tried another, then a third.  It seemed that perhaps because there  was no tight closure with the looser "" flat lid""  , the scent had ""worn off "" or ""worn away."" ""escaped""  When I mentioned this to my girlfriends at lunch, they had had the same experience with this kind of flat lid vs. the tight -fitting  glass, chunky lid.  So... If you want a lovely candle and are not looking for a scent,  this candle _style is for you. It burns slowly, ( all Yankee Candle do !!)  ,so you get more for your $.than a regular candle.  I just always buy Yankee Candles for their scent.  The scent is ALWAYS consistent, as is the quality of the product.  Yankee Candles don't get smokey as some candles often do. I'd also like to add that Yankee Candles do an excellent job wrapping and shipping their candles.  All the candles are well-wrapped and arrive amazingly fast. Bottom line ?  I LOVE  Yankee Candles .

The candle has a good scent (not sure if that's really eucalyptus) and once I coaxed out the wick, it worked. Not sure if it's the product manufacturer or the person/company that's shipping these!

How does that? Yankee candle goes to great lengths to ensure their candles arrive to you just as they suppose to, all in one piece.

Not one that you will light and then be almost empty  in a few short hours. I very much like that.

They also said that there are factors that that could impact the scent such as room size, other odours present, air flow and temperature (which sounds like hog wash to me).

The first had almost no throw, the second, almost no throw apart from burning wick scent, and then there was this: Yankee Candle's Midsummer's Night. I like the scent, but is very much like cologne, strong and heady. And it's rarely ever on sale like some of YC's other offerings. My first clue that something was off was the fact that Amazon shipped my order from the other side of the country, which they never do. My second clue was that while the YC box was undamaged, the softer material cradling the candle was stained and reeked of the candle itself. Ignoring the warning sign, I pulled the candle out and found that it was partially covered in fragrance oil and dark dye. I opened the candle and fragrance oil and dark dye sprayed out, onto the kitchen counter, my right arm, and one of my favorite Old Navy t-shirts. My spouse was nice enough to bleach the stains off the counter for me, but I will not be able to get the spots out of my t-shirt. Anyway, the candle was melted. The long trip across the country must have been too hot for it. And despite washing my arm twice, the strong scent and stains wouldn't come off until I had my shower that night. So I stank of Midsummer's Night for the rest of the day.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Sage & Citrus,B000P6THK8,BodeMeister,"This candle does burn clean but requires some tender care to make sure the less heated sides are involved and have to be pushed in with a knife to get the full liquid head that is required for a great burn.  It is a great scent that starts out very pungent sage that luckily goes down and is a nice soothing scent that is good for any relaxing event.  i have had several Yankee candles and have to say the 2 wick ones with soy just aren't as aromatic and as long lasting as the mottled paraffin ones they are known for.  It burns clean but so do the paraffin ones and not sure what the advantage is unless you are able to determine a toxin/comparison between the two. When it domes down to burning this I usually have to push the 2 sides that are not near the flames inward so it burns evenly. It does have a great scent that is better after the first burn which is wickidly strong. I prefer the later stages of subtle scent of sage with a very small amount of citrus poiking out.  It lasts long  but not as much as their large paraffin wax candles that seem to last for a very long time.  Great thing is no soot, smells great after the first burn.

I believe those reviews are accurate it does have the scent of men's cologne however I can look past that and I do like the aroma throughout the room and I continue to burn it it. If you keep the wick trimmed it does have long-lasting burning time.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Sage & Citrus,B000P6THK8,Brian D.,"I've learned my lesson about ordering candles from Amazon.  Of the three I ordered, one is completely unusable and the other two aren't great.  They all melted and re-hardened at some point.  It must have happened quite some time ago or in another area of the country, because it is in the 40s in Missouri right now. Hopefully two of them still work, the wax is flowing into the empty void to the side so it isn't getting a layer of melted wax on top.  As the pictures show, one of them can't even be lit.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Sage & Citrus,B000P6THK8,David Barker,I have been buying and trying several different candles recently as I enjoy them in my office while I work.  I bought this one because I recognized the name and the price was right for the volume of candle offered.  This one provides about twice the candle for the same price as some other name brands on Amazon.  Here's why. Wick is cheap and mushrooms a lot.  I had to trim it constantly to keep the flames from growing very large. Wax is cheap and smokes quite a bit.  Crackles and pops too. Scent is okay. My wife bought me a Mainstays (Target Store Brand) and I think it burns nicer; less smoke and mushrooming.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Sage & Citrus,B000P6THK8,Ian Parks,"This candle is better for a small space than a large room. I had it in my office at work, and it has a nice subtle, masculine scent. Smells faintly of cologne.  Gentle scent, not super strong or overpowering. A good gift for men who don't want a flowery or sweet smelling candle. I have noticed that when the wax is dark, the candle doesn't always burn evenly. Tent this one with foil to make sure it doesn't tunnel.

I had noticed that her candle was getting low, so I found this one here, purchased it for her. When the candle arrived she was ever so excited because this candle is so much larger.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Sage & Citrus,B000P6THK8,josh,"*14 DEC 2013 UPDATE: I've actually come around to the scent of this candle. I burn it more frequently and will definitely buy another when this one is done. It's potent and definitely appreciated by almost everyone that comes over to my house. Initially the candle is extremely overwhelming, and I'm even talking about when it is unlit. Within a couple weeks you'll love it. It's cheap and will definitely fill a whole house with a pleasant scent. Still, seek out the Voluspa candles. Their scents are more experienced and unique. Absolutely awesome candles. *ORIGINAL REVIEW: 24 yr old bachelor. I bought this because it was recommended as a 'manly' scent for my house. This smells like a cheap cologne / Axe Body spray, and to me it is a little overwhelming. Traveling with it, unlit in my car with the lid on gave me a slight headache. I don't have too much experience in candle selection but I would definitely seek this out before you purchase it. I know plenty of women out there probably appreciate this scent, and for the price you can't find too many masculine scents, but to me it reminds me of a frat house or a 16 year old kid getting ready for a date. I also purchased some Voluspa candles with this, and they are the best candles / scents I've ever experienced. The Voluspa scents I got are much more refined and resemble a more expensive and interesting cologne/guy smell. They are pricey, but I promise you they are worth it (buy the small sample sizes first) Here are the Voluspa scents that will blow you away: Suede Blanc, Ambre Lumiere, Warm Perique Tabac, Golden Cypress Sawara.",4.0,2013-05-31,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000P6THK8/?pageNumber=11

The wick has burned all the way down to the bottom but the sides are all the way up to the top.  It's like it burned a hole down the middle without using all of the wax. If this candle was $7 I would expect better.  But over $20 this is unacceptable.  Worst part is that this is the 3rd o e that has done the same thing. Last time I bought 2 mini candles and the same thing happened.  Figured I would try the bigger one because I like the scent, but I'm done with Yankee candles.  Sorry.

I realized recently a corporation purchased Yankee Candles, from the original owner, and he died. Again, I see the results of what happens when a greedy corporation buys anything good. They ruin it, and perhaps cut back or use a cheaper essential oil. Whatever they're doing, it's a shame. This decline has gone on for years, and I have had it! Why must corporation buy great companies and ruin what was once the best candle on the market?  From now on, I will purchase candles elsewhere, from another company..Perhaps the original sons new Candle company will return to create the original great scented candles.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Silver Birch",B00J6CH1VO,"Niagara,NY","I only buy Yankee Candles and usually from their local candle store in our area. However, due to the Covid Pandemic I decided to order on line via Amazon. I enjoy a woodsy candle scent during the winter months and my favorite was Cozy Cabin, that is discontinued. I ordered Velvet Woods for the holidays and it was absolutely satisfying and put me in a relaxing mood. This soy based candle melted evenly and the double wicks didn't fray. I bought Mountain Lodge at the same time, to try it too because it was a reasonable price. Sadly, the scent is hardly noticeable and the wick frays terribly. It may be due the difference in the soy verses just wax. I don't know if I just got a badly mixed candle but I'm very disappointed in this Mountain Lodge scent. Plus, the poor quality wick frays as it burns, shining an unequal glow. I may purchase the Mountain Lodge candle scent from a different seller just to compare the two. If you order this candle, I hope you have better luck.",2.0,2021-02-04,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00J6CH1VO/?pageNumber=2

It smelled lightly like my fond memories of mountain lodge, but I thought ‚Äúoh, it‚Äôll definitely be stronger when I light it‚Äù. That was my first mistake. Everyone knows most Yankee candles punch you in the nose when you smell them for the first time. My candle has been lit for about two hours now, and I smell absolutely nothing. I‚Äôm disappointed, to say the least. I know this isn‚Äôt something you should expect from Yankee candle, because I‚Äôve had this before and it was AMAZING. My house smelled so good!

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Silver Birch",B00J6CH1VO,Nikkole.NA.,"I know this candle has other reviews talking about it arriving melted beyond use to buyers,  but I still bought it thinking and hopeful that it could be a fluke thing. Well....it isn't. The Mountain Lodge candle arrived in the same box as another candle I bought (different brand) and long and behold the Yankee candle (like the reviews said) arrived half melted. I was one of the lucky ones though as I was still able to light the wick, however it isn't burning evenly now.  Very disappointed considering the price I paid for this candle., I've ordered MANY candles online (including Yankee) and have never had candles arrived melted. The candle it self smells absolutely great! A wonderful clean woodsy scent that doesn't have a over powering smell of pine like a lot of ""outdoorsy"" scented candles tend to have. It makes me reminisce about my stay in the mountains this past summer.  It also has a good throw but isn't super strong. I would definitely buy the candle again, maybe just not from Amazon?

That's not necessarily bad, although I haven't lit it yet so I don't know what it smells like when it burns. As you can see from my photos the whole candle melted before it even got to me, so I can't actually find the wick to light the candle anyway. Maybe it's my fault for ordering a candle in the summer time, but I guess the combination of heat from transit and the candle actually being packaged on its side means it's very possible someone else might receive a candle like mine (messy and unusable). I might try to leave it out in my car for a day to see if I can get it melted back into the jar, but there's no telling if I'll be able to find the wick even if that works.

The last candle few cables had major problems with it's appearance, and this was the 3rd one it has happened to. I tried to be calm and figured it was a mistake but after this 3rd one I am very disappointed. I don't know what happen but it became discolored and weird looking then lost its set its fragrance. I would like a replacement for the 3 candles for the inconvenience. I spent almost $80 and very upset that I was unable to smell and reminisce thinking of my mama that has past away from breast cancer.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Fresh Cut Roses,B00069ZDJS,Rachel,"As the title states, I suggest that you do not order candles while you're intoxicated. I hate patchouli so I have no idea why I ordered this candle. I think I liked the name of it and at the time I was searching for a candle to put in my bedroom. I don't think I bothered to read the description of the candle or the reviews, which I normally do, and ordered it simply because of the name and because I like other Yankee Candles. Even though the patchouli is not the main scent, the fact that I noticed it at all was enough for me to dislike it. Also the candle had some hardened bubbles on the top and was not level, like it had melted and was slightly tilted on its side and then hardened in place. Neither of those reasons would have caused me to return this item - just a heads up to anyone who doesn't like either of those things. I am returning only because the smell of this candle does not match my personal scent preferences at all. Ew.",1.0,2018-09-28,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00069ZDJS/?pageNumber=1

After lighting the candle I realize to my horror that the hair is embedded in the wax, so I then decide whatever I‚Äôll cut the price of hair out with a knife and the hair is really up in this candle. I ended up being able to pull the rest of the very long piece of hair out of my candle. Was it gross? Yeah. Did I still use the candle? Oh yeah it smells good.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Fresh Cut Roses,B00069ZDJS,The Machinist,"To the reviewer below: It's not Yankee Candles fault you ordered a scent u know u hate cuz your drunk & then have the audacity to give the product 1 lousy star, shameful.  With that said let me say I ordered 2 PINK SANDS scented lg . jar candles for office gifts and they were just as perfect a quality as tho bought in an actual Yankee store.  Stickers were straight, no bubbles, no hair as other reviewer tried to claim was case, filled level, wicks even. If you are wondering about the scent,  I guess I can best describe it as a sweet mix of those strawberry hard candies, with a pinch of a cotton candy ish smell somehow combined with a light beach scent swirled with suntan lotion, sandalwood laden sand anotherwords ... ABSOLUTELY DELISCIOUS and not too summery that u cant can't burn mid January.  Infact, it helps me erase a little winter depression when I burn. One VERY IMPORTANT thing to remember with these candles for longevity is #1 TRIM WICKS down to 1/8 inch and monitor length. If you are seeing black soot on glass, wicks is TOO long. Also, all good candles recommend you light for 2 to 4 hrs at a time, let cool then trim & re - light. If you do this you will have perfect results. Ps. Never burn last inch or two as glass can crack ... *tip: Scrape out last 2 inches or so with butter knife (can put cool candle in freezer for 10 min. first for less mess) and put in a tart/wax warmer or save to use in one later. It smells amazing, gives u a few tarts worth and more bang for your buck, enjoy!!",5.0,2019-12-13,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00069ZDJS/?pageNumber=1
Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Fresh Cut Roses,B00069ZDJS,Ashley Coffey,"Full disclosure: I am a Yankee candle devotee. My usual scent of choice is Kitchen Spice, but I ventured out for this one to replace a very expensive Volcano candle someone gifted me for luxurious baths. I was not about to drop $40 on a replacement jar candle, nosirree, so this Yankee candle, on sale of course, fit the bill. The scent is refreshing and sweet, but not too overwhelming, and it reminds me of strolling on the beaches of Hawaii, i.e. heaven.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Fresh Cut Roses,B00069ZDJS,Rebo Quintana,"I have bought and used several of these candles in different fragrances, including: Lilac blossoms, Midnight Jasmine, Midsummer‚Äôs Night, Pink Sands, and Silver Birch. I have four dogs and one enormous great room, which includes the kitchen, dining area, entry way, living area, and the dogs‚Äô niche where their beds are. So I am always battling the smell to keep the house smelling nice. Overall, I would give this brand of candles 5 stars. Four out of the five fragrances I‚Äôve tried were pleasant smelling, had a strong odor that would fill the large room, and a long life. They were packaged very well (inside their own box) and burn evenly. Here are my ratings for the scents: Lilac: Five stars. Very strong smell. Sweet and flowery. I love lilac but it was a bit much for my taste for the main part of the house. Jasmine: Five Stars (more if I could!). Wonderful scent. Flowery but not over powering. Mellow. Lots of compliments on this one and asking where I got it, etc. Can be hard to find, too. Recommended. Midsummer‚Äôs Night. Five Stars. Pleasant, ‚Äúsoapy‚Äù smell. Reminds me of what the bathroom smells like after a shower. I loved this scent, but it is nicer for a bathroom than a main room IMO. Recommended. Pink Sands. Two Stars. Very ‚Äúpink‚Äù smelling. Reminded me of bubblegum. Scent was very weak. Could barely smell it at all. Wish I had returned it. Not recommended. Silver Birch. Five Stars. Very ‚Äúwoodsy.‚Äù Makes me think of fall/winter. Very pleasant smell for a main room. Recommended. I definitely recommend these candles overall, especially the four scenes above. The Pink Sands candle was such a dud I had to take off a star, but really these are good candles and worth the price.",4.0,2020-09-29,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00069ZDJS/?pageNumber=2

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Fresh Cut Roses,B00069ZDJS,K&P Jodi,"These candles smell delicious! I will definitely be purchasing more of these. These candles also lasted a very long time as well. It was very cold outside and I had the fireplace going for two days straight since it was warmer in the living room and I decided to sleep in there. I also lighted the candle too and it burned for two days straight (not recommended). I did not blow it out once. The glass did not get too hot either. I always feel the candle glass when I burn a candle for a long length of time at once due to the fact that I have had them get too hot and break when the candle gets closer to the bottom of the wick. This candle stayed warm and did not get too hot. I was even able to light it for one more evening after I had it burning for 48 hours straight. When I lit it the 2nd time. I went ahead and let it burn down to the wick feeling the glass every now and then to make sure it wasn't getting too hot. It was fine and burned down to the wick like a good candle should do instead of burning less or half of the wax and then the wick is too short to light any longer. I promise that you will get your moneys worth with this candle. The flame is nice and bright and the smell is amazing. I ordered the Pink Sands, Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose, and the Honey Clementine. I have not burned the Honey-Clementine candle yet. It's a kitchen candle but I will burn it anywhere. All 3 candles that I had purchased were the larger 22 ounce candles. Thank you!

I had never smelled it, or even seen it in stores (I discovered upon looking into it that this is a new scent), and I thought why not? I am SO glad I went with my gut and just got it. The mix of the smells is just amazing. The apricot scent prevails over the rose for sure, which honestly surprised me! I feel like apricot is a hard smell to capture in a candle. The rose smell is also noticeable, but not over powering. It reminds me of the smell of Rosa  Double Delight roses (for those rose gurus out there) Which (for those of you who aren't gurus) is a sweet floral scent, with fruit like tones. This scent makes me feel super happy while its burning, and in my opinion is great for any time of day!

The smell is not terribly strong but also not necessarily weak, I imagine this would be a good choice for someone who likes fruity smells that aren't too overpowering. I gave this candle four stars instead of five because I was expecting a different (and admittedly stronger) smell but otherwise It is really a great candle.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Fresh Cut Roses,B00069ZDJS,Nekomancer,"I have been using candles for years. This is the only one that ever made me feel ill if I left it on for more than hour in a room that is about 11 by 12 feet. I am willing to admit its possible I could have some allergy I never knew about from something they used in the candle making process. However. My very expensive coway air purifier that detects noxious smells and turns up accordingly has never been affected by any candles, even when i tried putting them literally a foot away it only turns up when I light or put them out. But this candle made it go off every time. Even then I wouldnt give them such a low star rating. Just thought it worth mentioning because people might not realize the candle is making them feel nauseous if that is the case. The reason I am writint this is because the candle was listed at beinf 35+ hours. And while I dont time it. I did not that my 10 hour candle lasted a lot longer than this thing did. Keep in mind these are mostly oppinions. Not actual facts if you want to be technical. The candle itself smelled very nice I thought. But for the price they charge, and given my experience?

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Fresh Cut Roses,B00069ZDJS,AmazonAddict,"This is an honest non paid for non free item given review. Fresh Cut Roses is hands down my most favourite yankee candle scent ever! I normally buy the large jars but since the COVID stuff is going on, I couldn't afford the large jar. Next time, I will wait and spring for the large jar because this small tumbler does not do the scent justice. Even though we only place it in an average sized bathroom. The large jar that is placed in my bathroom will throw the scent in the bathroom and spew out into our entire master bedroom sized room very well and very strong! But this small tumbler barely fills just our bathroom. I assumed it would still saturate the bathroom but it did not. It was very weak. Maybe this yankee candle scent only works well in a larger jar than smaller jar. It did arrive with the wick not centered. It was a pain in the ass. We had to push the un-melted wax side down after each burn to even it out. But it still burned uneven and made more of a mess than tranquility. We contacted yankee candle directly and they did respond fast and did reimburse us, which was nice and surprising since some companies just say oh well too bad. That was the best part of this small tumbler experience. If you like yankee candle or have a favourite yankee candle scent. Get the largest jar for the best scent throw.

It‚Äôs a sweet scent, but also floral. It carried right through the top floor of the house (three bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a hallway). It‚Äôs a delicate apricot scent with a stronger scent of a rich summer rose. I also bought a Gardenia Yankee Candle and that has a much more delicate and floral scent (still with that heady richness of gardenia, but subtler than this one). If you don‚Äôt like sweet scents this may not be ideal for you, but if you want a powerful candle with a great throw, this one will be a great choice.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Fresh Cut Roses,B00069ZDJS,Reading since 9,"One of three floral scents (Rose and White Gardenia being two other favorites) I burn in my master bedroom, the combination is like being in a garden. In addition, because my bedroom is not enormous, the two each of the three scents, for a total of six large jar candles, gives off a genuine warmth, truly welcome on cold evenings. And of course the light from these candles, plus dim bedside lighting, gives a truly magical glow. I find the Yankee candles to be an unparalleled value for the length of burn time and the quality of the scent. There is no waxy smell, just pure romantic flowers. The floral scents, which I mostly favor, with the exception of the luscious black Midsummer Night's Dream, are true floral scents, almost as heady as the real blossoms themselves. When given the option, if you can afford it, always go for the large jars. By comparison, it is the best  value, giving a couple hundred plus hours of burn time. The only maintenance is trimming the wick after each burn and occasionally wiping off  the black soot from the top inch or so of the inside of the jar rim.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Fresh Cut Roses,B00069ZDJS,Cher,"This is my first time ordering a Yankee Candle. Read all the hype on this brand. Watched a couple of YouTubes; was impressed. I was juusst about to buy another brand which was going to cost me $15 for only 6 ounces (should have stuck with that choice). However, I found some Yankee Candles at a good price. Received my ""Pink Sands"" candle fast! (happy/excited) But what a BIG disappointment! Absolutely ""No scent"" from my candle? And No, I don't have Covid (lol) Usually you can smell at least a slight scent during the unboxing stage. Even when removing the lid, still no scent? That should have been a hint. However, I thought ""maybe"" I needed to burn it to smell it. Still nothing? Placed it in a small bathroom with the door closed for about 15 min, still no scent? Tested on two other people ~ same result. Is it possible I got a ""DUD""? Maybe it is old?  I don't need an expensive emergency ""power outage"" candle. What a waste of money! Unsatisfied Customer here for sure! Even though it said it was new on the listing, It ""seems"" like it was maybe a return? And I'm sure if it was, it was due to the same problem. Unfortunately, you can only return the candle in new or unused condition. All the favorite Yankee Candle scents that YouTubers put in their top/favorite lists like, ""Pomegranate Cider"" or ""Pumpkin Wreath"" are recently listed for double compared to what I paid. My candle ""Pink Sands"" was one of the lowest priced Yankee Candles I came across. Now I know why....I gave a rating of at least two stars. 1 for fast shipping and 1 for no broken glass.",2.0,2021-03-21,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00069ZDJS/?pageNumber=4

This used to be my favorite, but the quality & longevity isn‚Äôt worth the price anymore. The scent is great- if you have your nose glued to the jar. Otherwise, I didn‚Äôt find it emitted much of anything (even in a tiny, studio apartment). I only had it burning for 2-3 hours on occasion, but it didn‚Äôt last more than a month. And, the wick wasn‚Äôt strong enough to keep a decent flame... started to stifle with pooling wax that also dissipated so quickly the entire thing didn‚Äôt last. I would feel bad giving this as a gift. As nice as it seems- it isn‚Äôt worth it and kind of a waste of money. Their candles used to be WAY better in scent & longevity.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Fresh Cut Roses,B00069ZDJS,Reading since 9,"One of a trio of Yankee candle floral scents I like to burn in my master bedroom. The whole room smells like a garden, almost like the fresh flowers themselves. As an added bonus, the lighting is sublime and because our room is not enormous, the candles add actual warmth, very welcome on colder days, even in Georgia, which gets its fair share of cold days in Winter. The large jars burn a long time and I don't think I have found a brand that's worth what these Yankees are. The price you pay for them is worth it because they smell so wonderful and true to what they are labeled.

It still has more potent scent than most do by comparison since Yankee has cut back so severely but is still no as strong as it was when it first came out. However, this last order was very pleasant, I must say. They both burned slow and I could almost smell them from my living room into  the hallway but not quite and that was after burning the first one for over four hours!  That's a long time to burn in a small apartment and NOT smell it, actually considering there is no door between the living room and the hall... so no, it's not as strong as it should be but stronger than MOST Yankee candles. Pretty much all Yankee candles just don't cut it these days but I do love this scent and as long as I was sitting in the living room on the sofa I LOVEd this scent and really enjoyed it.

By the time half an hour hits, the flames are so tiny, I don‚Äôt even know how they manage to stay lit. I mean, you could walk past it in a hurry and they blow out. I guess I‚Äôll stick to jar candles from now on. Great fragrance and design and wax quality, but the wicks are awful. I do keep maintenance on my candles, so I know it‚Äôs not me overusing the wick without trimming them. Again, I‚Äôll stick to jar candles. Still believe in the Yankee Candle brand.

Yankee Candle Wild Orchid Signature Large Tumbler Candle,B08TZRRBMZ,Mellie,"I'm living at our beach condo this summer, and I burn this candle every day. It's so beachy, and is a little reminiscent of a nice-smelling suntan lotion from days of yore. Used to be that this scent was one of Yankee Candle's stronger ones. Now that most YC's have lost their strong scent (and some of them seem to have no scent at all), at least you can smell this one. But it is very light, so it's great for people like my sister who don't tolerate strongly scented candles. If I could buy the old version though, the more strongly scented one, I would! This one has the same scent, just not as strong. Also, I like that the two-wick tumbler is an option. Used to be it was only the one-wick large jar, the classic Yankee Candle. The two-wick tumbler has a more even burn, and you don't have to burn it for four full hours, as you do with the large one-wick jar, to maintain the integrity of the wax. And no worries about tunneling. So I buy the tumbler version. If I knew I wanted to be at home and burn it for four hours at a time, I'd buy the classic jar version. It lasts longer. PS - I did buy one the jar version of this candle recently, and the scent isn't any stronger than the tumbler version. So the reduced scent of Yankee Candles doesn't seem to have to do with which version you buy large jar or large tumbler. But the smaller of their candles do not seem to have as much scent throw, so I always buy the large ones.",4.0,2021-08-31,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08TZRRBMZ/?pageNumber=1

Yankee Candle Iced Berry Lemonade Signature Large Tumbler Candle,B08TZS82PY,J.Adams,"I actually ordered a Yankee Candle Signature Large Tumbler Candle with two-wicks in the scent Black Tea and Lemon. Instead, I received a Yankee Candle Scentlight, which is fine. It's a much more expensive product and there's no risk of fire with this essential oil diffuser. The Yankee Candle Scentlight Essential Oil Diffuser Set comes with a diffuser that lights up and an essential oil cartridge. The diffuser can be plugged in or used with batteries. .There's a convenient timer on the diffuser that allows for 5 hours per day use and lasts up to 30 days. In my opinion, that's great cartridge life! This Scentlight Essential Oil Diffuser would make a terrific gift for anyone, but especially for a college student, someone just moving into their own place, or a thoughtful housewarming gift! Because the Yankee Candle Scentlight uses cartridges, you'll get indefinite use out of one diffuser! You also won't have the concerns you'd normally have with burning candles. I'm sending this Scentlight diffuser to college with our son this fall. He said he'd love to have it and I'm sure it'll make living in a dorm room more acceptable!

Yankee Candle Iced Berry Lemonade Signature Large Tumbler Candle,B08TZS82PY,Susie Williams,"I didn't receive the product I ordered, but instead am reviewing this Scentlight, which is a flameless candle that's operated with a fan. Products like these have come a long way over the years and this is a good-looking diffuser that I don't mind keeping out (some of them are so ugly and/or cheesy and don't mix well with my decor). It also works really well! My diffuser came with a Clean Cotton fragrance refill, but when that's gone, I could purchase any other refills I wanted. Luckily, I do love Clean Cotton! I currently have this in my kitchen to test it out, but will probably move it to a bedroom since clean cotton isn't the best kitchen fragrance! However, it is very strong and despite the fact I have a large kitchen that opens up into a dining room and office, it's almost too much for me and I fear it will be way too much for a small bedroom. I do think it's better to have it too strong rather than not strong enough... It just means I usually have to turn it off long before the 5 hour timer is up. I haven't even turned it on in a few days and can still smell it when I walk by it. I love the little glow it gives off.  It automatically makes a space feel more special. Overall, this is a great product that works really well and will fit in nicely with most decor!",4.0,2021-08-09,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08TZS82PY/?pageNumber=7
Yankee Candle Iced Berry Lemonade Signature Large Tumbler Candle,B08TZS82PY,Amazon Customer,"As you can see from my photos, what I received was not the tumbler candle. I received a ""Scent Light"" fragrance warmer. It is a battery powered(4 AA batteries, not included) warmer that uses little scent pods(1 included). Even though it wasn't what I had ordered, I really like it. It's pretty when it's not on and even prettier when it is on. The scent pod smelled really strong and I was worried that it would be overpowering and give me a headache but in the warmer the scent is lighter. It has a good ""throw"" and will scent a rather large space but it's not a heavy or just ""too much."" I wish it had a plug in or USB option but being battery powered means you can put it just about anywhere and not worry about whether there's an outlet nearby. There is a timer feature that allows you to set it to be on for 5hrs and then shut off and then come on again automatically at the same time the following day.",4.0,2021-07-02,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08TZS82PY/?pageNumber=7
Yankee Candle Iced Berry Lemonade Signature Large Tumbler Candle,B08TZS82PY,August Chianese,"Instead of the Black tea and lemon candle, they sent me a Scent Light which is a kind of diffuser which Yankee sells refills for. Mine came with Clean Cotton. Actually very happy because this thing works wonders! Put it in the corner of the room and let it go and the whole room gets a nice bit of fragrance to it that isn't too much but remains noticeable enough. It has been running a few hours a day now for over a month and its still going, so I think that's a good sign. Plus the device itself is nice looking. Its like a silver cannister design with a wood-like bottom, plus it has a light inside that pokes through little transparent spots in the silver coating. Very contemporary looking, could match with just about any decor. If you do think about getting one, I highly recommend them. I'll be getting refills for mine.",5.0,2021-09-11,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08TZS82PY/?pageNumber=8
Yankee Candle Iced Berry Lemonade Signature Large Tumbler Candle,B08TZS82PY,Bookwyrm,"I'm another one who thought she was getting the candle and received a Scentlight instead. I will say that the scentlight is an effective and attractive way to scent the home. It has a nice subtle pattern and doubles as a nightlight. It can be plugged in or powered by batteries and has a timer that will make it diffuse the oil for 5 hours at the same time each day so you don't have to turn it on manually. However, the ""cotton"" scent is very strong - so strong that I didn't even have to turn the diffuser on for the scent to fill the room. It mostly smells of laundry detergent - not exactly what I was looking for.",3.0,2021-07-14,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08TZS82PY/?pageNumber=8

It's really nice, but I will say I'm a little bummed I didn't get to see what the black tea fragrance smells like! I love black tea, so a candle in the fragrance would be so perfect for me. Instead I got a diffuser with a clean cotton type fragrance. It works great for the bathroom, providing a night light and fresh scent throughout the day. There's a setting for having it run all the time, or 6 hours. I use the 6 hour one and it works great.",5.0,2021-08-19,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08TZS82PY/?pageNumber=8

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Sparkling Snow",B0044R5L6S,SKCWriter,"Who doesn't love Yankee Candles? No one I know. I would be hard pressed to name my #2 favorite fragrance, for there are several, depending on the season. But Sparkling Snow is my all-time, all-year favorite. When I was teaching, my classroom was three-quarters of the way down a long hall.  I would arrive early every morning, and part of my routine was to light my S'Snow candle. By the time the students and other faculty members arrived, the hall smelled like new-fallen snow in a piney woods. Many commented on how much they liked it, even the students. It's a fresh, clean fragrance--not overwhelming like some strong pine cleaner at all. I also appreciated that it lasted a very long time, and would last even longer on a candle warmer.

"Yankee Candle Elevation Collection with Platform Lid Dark Berries Scented Candle, Large 2-Wick, 80 Hour Burn Time",B07D39HSRQ,Jamie w,"I have been burning candles for years. I buy a variety of brands. I started using Bath and Body candles. Never again. This particular Yankee candle is the greatest candle I have ever had. We have had our home up for sale so people come by and take a look. Before anyone shows, we light one down stairs, one up in our large master and one in a guest room at the end of home (3000 sq ft). I could just lite 2 but the third one is a tiny one and just perfect for far end of house. Everyone that walks through comments on how heavenly the home smells. It is fresh, floral but not overly strong, very clean and throws the perfect amount and it remains after they are put out. The lids on the Dark Berry are awesome. I place it under before lighting and cap it off after. Highly recommend this PERFECT balanced candle. Never had a problem with wicks or shipping as some have mentioned. Mine came packed beautifully in thick bubble wrap and proper cardboard cut out base to stop from shifting in shipping.",5.0,2019-09-20,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07D39HSRQ/?pageNumber=1
"Yankee Candle Elevation Collection with Platform Lid Dark Berries Scented Candle, Large 2-Wick, 80 Hour Burn Time",B07D39HSRQ,EmBee,"Love: the scent of this. It is one my whole family enjoys. Scent makes the house smell like someone is cooking a light Berry jam in kitchen. Great throw. In a first floor of over 2000 sq ft , two candles scent everything substantially. The color and jar are attractive as well. So pretty when it burns. Sorta a pain tho is how this two wick still tunnels. The square shape causes wax to pool away from corners. So I must push wax down after burning to stop it from tunneling badly. This does help a lot. So anyone who experiences this, go ahead and push wax down in corners toward middle when wax is soft. It prevents severe or moderate tunneling.",5.0,2019-03-04,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07D39HSRQ/?pageNumber=1

"Yankee Candle Elevation Collection with Platform Lid Dark Berries Scented Candle, Large 2-Wick, 80 Hour Burn Time",B07D39HSRQ,DDC,"I was really pleased with this candle.  First, I have always loved Yankee Candle.  I think that their products are really high quality and the fragrances never cloying. This candle did not disappoint! I was a little fearful that it would smell like the Strawberry Shortcake dolls of my youth :-) but the scent was very pleasing.  It was a gentle fragrance that hung lightly in the background without overpowering.  Everyone in the family thought it smelled nice too. The jar itself was a little different than typical, as it is more square in shape.  It has a pretty copper-looking lid.  When you take the lid off, you place it under the candle and it acts both as a decorative base, but it also has a rubber bumper which keeps the candle from sliding around- and would protect your table too.  It is a double wick candle, which means that it will burn evenly without having to put a topper on the jar. One thing to note is that the actual ounces of the candle are a little less than the typical 'large jar' candle, though the pricing seems to be the same.  I'm sure that is because this candle has more elegant features which cost more to make.  Overall, I thought this was beautiful and I can see myself buying more.",5.0,2018-08-16,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07D39HSRQ/?pageNumber=3

I love the solidity of the base and candle. This is because of the square design, which I prefer to the round. It's so classy looking and the dark berry scent is just lovely and in my opinion not overwhelming like many floral scents can be.  Thanks Yankee for this unique design!",5.0,2018-09-05,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07D39HSRQ/?pageNumber=3
"Yankee Candle Elevation Collection with Platform Lid Dark Berries Scented Candle, Large 2-Wick, 80 Hour Burn Time",B07D39HSRQ,Laura0806,"Even burning and long lasting. The first 1/2 brined quite quickly but then became much more smooth burning. The glass, caps, and even wax colors of these candles is what won be over. They are not feminine but just neutral. As a married man I‚Äôm not typically the one candle shopping, but I‚Äôd have no haste to carry these around the store to the check out. They aren‚Äôt corny-masculin (like ‚Äúwoods‚Äù or ‚Äúmeat‚Äù smelling candles aimed directly at men), rather just pleasantly neural. Gold tone is back, and the lids which double as bases will pick it up any gold or light bronze accents in your home (like doorknobs for example). The smell is great. Subtle, and inviting, nothing like a electric sent maker which tend to smell almost static. The Dark berry reads just like that, almost as the neighbor is baking a blackberry pie and you‚Äôre getting nice warm hints of the smell in your home without being overpowering. Surely recommended for a fresh, inviting home and as an accent piece in and of itself.",5.0,2018-08-27,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07D39HSRQ/?pageNumber=3
"Yankee Candle Elevation Collection with Platform Lid Dark Berries Scented Candle, Large 2-Wick, 80 Hour Burn Time",B07D39HSRQ,Maxwell Edison,"This is a solidly made candle. The glass container is very sturdy and the metal lid fits tightly with an embedded gasket that works as designed. This would make a nice gift since the materials are so nice and the overall visual design is definitely upscale. Most of all, I really like the scent. It's technically ""gourmand"" in that it resembles something edible, in this case berries. But it's not the chemical-berry scent you get in cheaper candles, and the berry element is balanced by a nice floral note. Overall, it's not a domineering fragrance; it's subtle enough to use in any room.",5.0,2018-09-08,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07D39HSRQ/?pageNumber=4
"Yankee Candle Elevation Collection with Platform Lid Dark Berries Scented Candle, Large 2-Wick, 80 Hour Burn Time",B07D39HSRQ,Quickbeam,"I am a Yankee Candle regular. This large square candle is a new shape and scent for me. I love that this candle had a double wick; the large candles with only 1 tend to tunnel. This burns evenly and I appreciate that. The Dark Berries scent is deeply fruity and kind of heady, very fragrant. It fills our largest room well with scent. I really like the square container as it fits in perfectly with a midcentury modern decor. The whole lid serves as a platform thing is a non-issue for me; the heavy glass container is very sturdy all on its own. I guess if you want a place to store the lid, this would serve.

"Yankee Candle Elevation Collection with Platform Lid Dark Berries Scented Candle, Large 2-Wick, 80 Hour Burn Time",B07D39HSRQ,unitydienes,"This is a heavy, nicely designed candle.  If I rotate the candle, I can hide the label so it just blends into my decor, or I could just peel off the plastic label for the ultimate elegance. I love how the lid fits under the candle.  Usually I just end up having a lid perched nearby when I‚Äôm burning this style of candle, but now I have a place to put it, that actually enhances the look of the candle. I‚Äôm not entirely crazy about the Dark Berries scent, which is why I rated it 4 stars.  It‚Äôs a very sweet scent, and Yankee Candles are so good at filling the room with the scent that it gets quite overpowering quickly.

She lights a candle in the kitchen now and then to mask or otherwise combat cooking odors. I don‚Äôt recall ever having a double-wick candle and it was interesting to watch. Instead of a single wick burning a deep hole into the candle, the double-wick results in a wider, shallower hole, which I think will keep the candle usable for a longer time without carving it up.

I like that the lid turns into a 'plate' for the candle but it seems a bit slippery to me so I'm not sure I will continue with that but it is a nice option.

"Yankee Candle Elevation Collection with Platform Lid Dark Berries Scented Candle, Large 2-Wick, 80 Hour Burn Time",B07D39HSRQ,HoneyüçØ,"Scent: Dark Berry This is a nice big candle with two wicks. They burn down nicely without sinking too far into the wax, so relighting the candle is relatively easy. As long as the wicks continue to hold up, the candle will last for many hours. The candle can sit on the lid when it's in use, although the design isn't perfect for that purpose. As one expects from Yankee Candle Company, the scent is rich, and this one is redolent with the fragrance of mixed berries. It is a good quality candle, as far as its form and function. There is one big deterrent in my opinion though, and that is the color of the wax in this particular scent, Dark Berry. It is a smoke gray color and frankly, it's ugly. The drab color really detracts from the ambiance one expects a decorative candle to deliver.",3.0,2018-08-18,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07D39HSRQ/?pageNumber=5
"Yankee Candle Elevation Collection with Platform Lid Dark Berries Scented Candle, Large 2-Wick, 80 Hour Burn Time",B07D39HSRQ,FlowerGirl16,"I never thought I'd consider a candle well designed, but this one certainly is.  The jar is wide and tall, very substantial, with two wicks that, after several hours of burning, have kept the wax consistently level.  The lid acts as a sturdy base.  Both labels (one on the lid and one on the front of the jar) peel off easily without leaving behind any residue.  When burning, the candle don't produce any noticeable smoke. The Dark Berries scent is fruitier than I usually prefer, but it's nice.  It smells like blueberries, but also kind of reminds me of grape bubblegum.  The first time my son smelled it, he asked ""What are you baking?""

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Magical Frosted Forest",B00O60M2D8,SUNNYBROOK,"This forest scent was piney and natural, and I have no complaints about the candle itself, but during shipment in June, some of the evergreen fragrance oils leaked out of the jar and then ate completely through the styrofoam packing material cushioning the cap of the jar. The substance wasn't melted wax, but was actual green coloring plus oil that leached OUT of the wax. This is indicative to me either that there was a problem with product quality control or that Amazon should not have been shipping it to my location (Texas) in June, I purchased another scent (Cranberry Twist) that shipped in the same box, and it was fine with no leakage.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Caf√© Al Fresco,B01NAAQLZ1,David S. Young,"I don‚Äôt know why Yankee Candles chose to dramatically reduce, or at times eliminate the scent in their candles. They were reknown for consistently strong scents, that wafted throughout your home, but no longer. I purchased 20 for gifts last Christmas, and no aroma at all could be smelled in 11 of them. Too late to buy other gifts or return them. I had them wrapped and distributed. I still feel guilty. Many Companies risk quality when mass produced for Amazon. I‚Äôll never buy another, anywhere. Without vigilent quality control batch testing, a manufacturer often goes bankrupt. Amazon must educate and inspect quality measures consistently, lest they sale garbage.

It's absolutely wonderful to light about 20 minutes before I have my morning cup of coffee. There's just something special about the background of baking cookies while sipping coffee. My husband loves it too. Whenever he walks into room he says ""that candle smells so good!"" It arrived on Wednesday and I've been burning it every day. It's about half used. Not bad. Like other single-wick candles, the wax often needs to be scraped down the side otherwise a cavernous hole develops down the middle around the wick.

Since this came from the Yankee company I was really expecting these to be exactly as you find them in the store, but I would wrong with that thought.

ZIP. Even when I put my nose right up to it, lit or unlit, I smell NOTHING. I usually buy the Woodwick Vanilla candles, which are phenomenal. I happened to have one stashed away, so got it out, lit it up, and the wonderful vanilla aroma filled the room, and the whole house.....along with the delightful fireplace-like crackle of a Woodwick candle.

I'm really surprised because I have 2 other yankee candles right now that are very powerful. I've never had this issue with this brand. Although, this is the first time I've purchased one online. Maybe it's an online scam, like it's a regular candle and they slap on a yankee label. The other candles, that actually have a scent, I bought at Bed Bath & Beyond.

The box and the protective enclosure inside was a little damaged, but that was it. So, I'm a happy camper with this purchase!

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Caf√© Al Fresco,B01NAAQLZ1,Andre,"Great scent if you love birthday cake. Unfortunately everyone goes nose blind to scents after a while of being in the vicinity of a scent and after those few first glorious minutes of being in a room with this candle lit, you won't even notice the smell. That is ... until you walk out the room to so something (whether to go to the kitchen, bathroom, etc) and return to the room. Then the soothing smell of fresh birthday cake returns for a few minutes. Nose blindness is no fault of the candle. Just our stupid noses üò† Anyways I used this candle beyond what was recommended and had no issues. Do so at your own risk but I did use the candle until all the wax was nearly completely burned out. I've lit, put out, and relit this candle multiple times with no issue. So long as the bottom of the glass isn't getting hot there shouldn't be a risk of the candle and glass exploding. But then again, what do I know? Do so at your own risk but I just could not allow myself to stop using this candle once the wax reached below half. It smelled too good to waste. Also this candle is very aesthetically pleasing in a room. It blends in and the fire burning inside the glass jar just looks elegant.

They really last a long time and will permeate the room if you burn them long enough. I accidentally left a pumpkin one burning for two days in the back of our house. That room smelled lovely for weeks and weeks. If you get yours and the packaging has residue all over it, just wash the candle and lid off and it's fine.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Caf√© Al Fresco,B01NAAQLZ1,SUE-ELLEN DAVISON,"Yankee Candle's primary claim to fame was always their marvelous scents. This Salted Caramel ""scented"" candle has none. The only scent you'll detect is if you stick your nose into the jar before lighting. Yes, there's a scent there, but no matter how long you burn it, you're never going to get to enjoy Salted Caramel or any other scent wafting about your room. It's just not there. And yes, my sense of smell is still good, thank you for asking. Also, the Yankee Candle makers, like all candle makers, used to know how to gauge the thickness of their wicks so that they burned down at the same rate that the wax melted. The company has stopped concerning themselves with that nicety since they've decided it's really their customers' job to constantly trim the wicks. If you overlook that, next thing you know, a six-inch flame will be shooting out of the jar threatening to crack it and/or set your curtains or something else on fire. Yankee Candle has evidently lost interest in selling a quality product. That might be all right if they had the decency to reduce their prices accordingly because their new product is  only worth the price of the jar. That, at least, can be used for something. I've loved Yankee Candles for more than 40 years, but now I'm looking for a candle maker who still knows how to make candles.",1.0,2019-04-18,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01NAAQLZ1/?pageNumber=4

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Caf√© Al Fresco,B01NAAQLZ1,Matt Wallenstein,"I like to burn candles in my apartment because I find that freshening sprays don't always last as long as I would like, and incense is just too strong and invasive for me to want to use it consistently. Yankee's salted caramel scent is probably my favorite one so far. It is extremely sweet-smelling as you would expect, but it is not sickeningly sweet like I was worried it would be. It almost reminds me of bread baking or fresh cookies. It is a very warm and soothing smell that I would not necessarily describe as subtle because it will definitely fill up a room, but it is not overpowering and becomes part of the scenery. I got the Bahama Breeze scent along with this, and while I like that one, the scent is not nearly as strong as this one and is much less noticeable. I would be cautious of giving this as a gift to someone because I could see some thinking it is overly sweet. I don't think it is, but I like sweet scents so I may have a higher tolerance than some people. On the same token, I definitely recommend trying this for yourself, it's definitely a treat and will make you feel cozy the whole time it's burning.",5.0,2020-08-13,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01NAAQLZ1/?pageNumber=5

Two Spiced Pumpkin, which has a strong cold scent, but again little scent throw when lit. And the 5th candle, called Home Sweet Home, we haven't yet burned. Hopefully, results will be better.

Its cloying, heavily charred, burnt maple stench just sticks to the back of the throat like mad medicine. Plus, unlike some Yankee Candles, the stench is STRONG and lingers, so there is no escaping it before for quite a while afterwards. Even my poor dog's fur smelled of it for days.

Long lasting, burns evenly. I know they‚Äôre pricey but compare your burn hours. Smells wonderful!",4.0,2018-10-09,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B06X6H95GW/?pageNumber=1
"Yankee Candle Sicillian Lemon Scented Premium Paraffin Grade Candle Wax with up to 150 Hour Burn Time, Large Jar",B06X6H95GW,Mermaid Girl,"This candle smells absolutely AMAZING! The scent is strong enough to notice in another room, yet not too overpowering. I would describe it as a sweet apple smell but not sickly sweet if that makes sense. It is just enough to make any event delightful. I just received it yesterday and tried it last night. The color is wonderful too. I find Yankee Candles to be the very best and I have several of them now. This one is among my very favorites. Another fave is the sage & citrus. This is very different from that scent though so I can decide upon mood. I would highly recommend this candle if you are looking for something softly sweet and fruity scent.

"Yankee Candle Sicillian Lemon Scented Premium Paraffin Grade Candle Wax with up to 150 Hour Burn Time, Large Jar",B06X6H95GW,Maria Robin Estes,"I ordered 2 of these candles which were sold by the same company. They were shipped and arrived on different days. I‚Äôm still trying to understand why. Both candles were shipped poorly. The 1st had the top tapped as if done by an elementary student and thrown in a box. The 2nd appeared to have been taped, but somehow the top became detached and it was shipped in an envelope. What I noticed upon opening the envelope was lack of fragrance. I cleaned away the tape and decided to light the candle and burn for a couple of hours. I was extremely dissatisfied. There was a very faint fragrance and the candle began to burn straight down the center. I‚Äôve purchased this candle in the past. I know how beautiful the fragrance is or should be and these candles last for a long time. The candle that I‚Äôve been using in my bathroom was purchased in November 2019 and while I don‚Äôt burn it every day. It is still very fragrant and after a year still has quite a bit of burn time left. My Plan was to gift one of these candles to a friend for her Birthday but due to the tacky wrapping, it simply is not presentable!! Poor quality and presentation for the Cost.

I was looking for a fresh, energizing scent.  This was not it at all.  It's not bad, but it is a bit muted. You don't really smell cilantro, but I also don't quite get a pineapple scent.  It smells like a stronger version of a glade candle, to be honest.  It is not a bad scent, but it is not something one expects from Yankee.  It is long lasting and it does drown out kitchen cooking smells, so that's why I still gave it 2 stars .",2.0,2018-10-21,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B06X6H95GW/?pageNumber=2

"Yankee Candle Sicillian Lemon Scented Premium Paraffin Grade Candle Wax with up to 150 Hour Burn Time, Large Jar",B06X6H95GW,Toby Moore,"This was purchased as a small Valentine's gift for my wife.  I had bought her a Lemon Verbena candle (different brand) for Christmas, which smelled really nice.  But then we noticed the terrible black soot it left on her home office walls and ceiling...so much for buying another.  She's had dozens of Yankee candles over the years with no issues, and this one was ""Amazon's Choice"" so I went for it.  Simply put, this jar missed the fragrance nozzle on the assembly line.  We're talking basically no lemon, unless you concentrate it in a very small location.  And even then you have to practically singe your eyebrows off leaning into it to smell anything.  Nothing like other Yankee stuff in the past.  Production mistake?  Yankee's new cost-cutting philosophy?  Who knows.  Just $17 wasted.  We'll go back to generic candles bought at the supermarket.

I however don't, and got this candle only out of the ""cilantro"" curiosity which I don't understand what is doing on the label at all. The scent is pleasant and I will burn it since it is very enjoyable, it is somewhat ""thick"", sweet, tropical with a lot of pineapple to it. Reminds me of my Oahu vacation :) The scent is pretty prominent, not the most fragrant of other Yankees that I have, but I would rate it as medium on the fragrant scale. A good choice for someone who gets headaches from strong overwhelming scents. As other Yankees this lasts forever, I have used it quiet a few times now, and it is almost full (see the picture).

Don't be fooled by the ""cilantro"" in the title. I don't smell any cilantro, unless it's the fresh aspect I smell with the candle. What I do smell when I burn it, is a smell identical to the smell I experience when I cut up a fresh, ripe, very sweet pineapple. That scent is very predominant in this candle. I also smell sweet coconut, but heavier on the pineapple. It's a perfect balance, and definitely a sweet smell, though not at all in a bad way. When I burn it, the throw is strong. I'd say a 7.5 or so, and it fills my room wonderfully. I can't recommend this one enough.

I was expecting a candle when burning would give off the smell of lemons. Maybe  Sicillian lemons smells different. I don't know but this scent is not to my liking. I can't even describe the odor, it is sort of sweet but not fruity. At any rate if you're expecting the smell of lemons this is not what you want to buy. The jar is nice and the color is very pretty.

The scent kind of reminds me of the ""Love Is"" bubble gum from my childhood, otherwise I don't know what to compare it to. It is sweet and fruity. Something otherworldly heavenly beautiful and delicious. Amazing scent. The fragrance strength of this candle is 3 out of 5 - ok/acceptable: it is not the strongest but either the weakest of Yankee scents. Fills up the small bedroom nicely, but nothing that fills up the whole house like other Yankees. I would have expected a stronger scent from a Yankee candle, but overall worth it.

It's sweet and exotic, and so relaxing. It's not overbearing and it doesn't get too strong or sickly-sweet smelling when the candle is burning, which is an issue I have with many cheaper candles I buy. The 22 oz. jar is nice and big, and the packaging boasts over 100 hours of burn time, which I can attest to. I lit this one 2-5 hours a day for over 5 weeks before it burnt out. My only complaint would be that I still have probably a half of an inch of wax in the bottom of the jar, but my wick is completely burnt. This could be be due to the fact that I had to blow it out at one point, and if I had kept burning it, the wax would have been used up completely. Otherwise, this is a wonderful product--pineapple and cilantro aren't two scents you'd think to combine, but they're fantastic together!

Combining lavender with lemon is perfect for me, as it relaxes me but also uplifts me, and so I used this during the day, and absolutely LOVE it. I extinguish the flame by putting back the lid, so the smoke stays inside the container. I noticed that the smell lasts long even after I had extinguished it, and even the days I don't lit it and the container is closed I can still smell the scent. Super high quality and lovely. Highly recommended. NOTE - I have never tested CVD  positive in the two years here in NYC, and never lost my sense of smell.",5.0,2021-12-28,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000WQZ5PC/?pageNumber=1
Yankee Candle 1073481EZ Large Jar Candle Lemon Lavender,B000WQZ5PC,P. Thompson,"First of all, Yankee Candles are one of the best that I've found and one of my go to candle companies.  Even unlit, the scent is pleasantly alive, though not as strong as when lit. For this particular scent, I was looking for a lavender scented candle specifically to burn in the evening to relax me before going to bed.  While this one isn't entirely lavender, the combination is almost mouthwatering.  Must be the addition of the lemon.  Lemon, or any citrus, is a fond favorite of mine as well. It's been a while since I've been able to burn candles and I'm so glad I can still get my favorites from Yankee.",5.0,2021-12-25,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000WQZ5PC/?pageNumber=1

Check the label on the bottom if you order multiple candles.  When I ordered from this page it showed 'lemon lavender'.  It does not throw a strong scent.  However, it lasts longer than my other yankee candles.  It has a different label on the bottom.  I think I got a knock off that was not as strong, but lasted longer.

This lavender lemon scent is a very refreshing and relaxing scent. It is one of those candles that smells more strongly once you light it, but it isn't a bad thing. It is not overwhelming, or nauseating. It is great for a smaller or larger space because of the type of scent (not too sweet/overpowering).

Yankee Candle 1073481EZ Large Jar Candle Lemon Lavender,B000WQZ5PC,Tricia,"UPDATED: So this has grown on me, I stick it in the bathroom and eventually the entire house will smell... the smell doesn't smell cheap to my anymore. Perhaps just the top layer was concentrated or something? Truly smells like lavender and lemons. By the time it fills the rest of the house it smells like soft lavender and soft lemon... and it's a bit stronger in the bathroom where it should be. I love it now! ------------- Woah.. this is strong. When reviews say it is very strong, they're not joking. I'm not entirely too fond of the smell. It's not a cheapy bathroom cleaner smell, but it certainly smells like it belongs in the bathroom. It is a little too strong for anywhere else. I was hoping it would be a good kitchen candle, but I rather use the pure lemon scent in the kitchen, and use this one in the restroom.

"Yankee Candle Elevation Collection with Platform Lid Passionflower Scented Candle, Large 2-Wick, 80 Hour Burn Time",B07P9S8VZR,JPH,"This is my first, and probably my last, Yankee Candle. Takes a while to get going and would probably have been more effective as a 3-wick rather than 2-wick candle.  Scent throw is very good, subtle but pervasive over a wide area and remains in the air for a while after the candle is extinguished/covered.  The scent is very floral, pleasant, but I don't pick up the advertised lime/jasmine tea. As one reviewer has noted, after the candle burns down a bit, it really does look like a brain.  There are channels throughout the candle, making it look like the amygdala.  Perhaps a cost-cutting measure, candle burns using less wax. This candle was a nice one-off, nothing about the candle that would compel me to purchase it again.",3.0,2021-10-29,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07P9S8VZR/?pageNumber=2

First off, I got the tall tumbler with the 2 wicks. It was only $14 which was well worth it, in my opinion. These candles live up to the hype. The scent is wonderful and aromatic. Reminds me of fall which is exactly what I was trying to go for. These candles burn so evenly. I don't know if that's due to the brand and their formula in general or the double-wick, but I love it. I've burned for hours already and it's only gone down maybe about half an inch.

"Yankee Candle 1131264Z Large 2-Wick Tumbler Candle, Red Apple Wreath",B001U3WTP0,Eusebius,"I like most all of the larger candles from Yankee Candle, but I don't really love this one. Even though the scent is somewhat reminiscent of apples and cinnamon, to me it smells a little too artificial. When I first lit it and later came back into the room I couldn't recognize the scent and couldn't connect it with the candle. Maybe it's the walnut and maple that throws it off, but either way, it's not my favorite. I like it, but not as much as the other Yankee Candle fragrances. As I wrote in another review, we've tried different brands of fragrance candles and none of them even come close to the Yankee Candles. They are long lasting and fragrant - the scent is even and continuous right down to the bottom of the candle. Other cheaper brands don't last ¬º the time or have ¬º the scent and actually turn out to be more expensive than a Yankee Candle in the long run.",3.0,2015-06-11,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B001U3WTP0/?pageNumber=7

This candle had no scent and the wick burned so quickly that I had to dump out wax so the flame would stay lit.  Even after dumping out wax, the wick burned unusually fast (for a Yankee candle). I went out and bought a comparable Yankee Candle from a reputable, authorized dealer and the difference was night and day.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Autumn Wreath",B000TVJ6XW,Kyle H,"During pretty much any time of year I'm burning candles. I've burned cheaper ones like ""American home"" or ""village candle"" and I've burned nicer one's like ""yankee"" or ""kringle"". The cheaper candles are always faster burning and less fragrant. It's worth it to get a decent candle. Unless you REALLY want a specific (usually seasonal) scent, don't pay more than around 18$ for one of these. I've seen a bunch on here for like 25$+ and at that cost you're better off ordering kringle or some ""artisan"" brand. For 18ish bucks this candle is fantastic. This specific scent has lasted longer than some others, in that everyday I light it I can still smell it despite burning it for a week. Your nose and sense of smell is logarithmic (like your other senses) and after you have been exposed to the same smell for long enough, your brain stops recognizing it as unique and potent to your environment.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Autumn Wreath",B000TVJ6XW,Karina-Oh!,"It's worth the effort to always see what Amazon Warehouse has in stock before you buy your item. I've gotten in the habit of doing this when I'm looking for a Yankee Candle. I found a Spiced Pumpkin large jar candle just a couple of days ago that was reduced to $13.39. So I decided to give it a shot. All of my past experiences have been good and this one was no exception! It arrived 1 full day early & it was very carefully packed. Upon opening, the jar was in excellent condition. Everything about the candle is authentic Yankee quality. However, when I removed the glass lid I saw that the wick was slightly singed, yet none of the wax surrounding it had been melted. Sort of like it had been lit and immediately blown out. It wasn't intended to be a gift; but if it was it wasn't giftable, so I rated it only 1 star for that category. I lit my candle and in a few seconds, no one was the wiser, lol...

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Autumn Wreath",B000TVJ6XW,Joe E.,"I have purchased many different brands of candles over the years trying to find a company that competes in its fragrances with Yankee candles. I finally decided several years ago that I would only buy Yankee candles and stop wasting my money on the other brands, since I am always disappointed with them. I was thrilled when I found my favorite Cranberry Chutney jar candle available on Amazon a couple of weeks before Christmas. However, as I have burned it over the past several days, I have been extremely disappointed. My house used to be filled with the delicious aroma from this candle, but this time, I can barely smell it. I have heard the excuse that people are complaining about Yankee candles' scents this year due to a loss of smell from Covid-19. That is not the case with me, because I have not contracted covid, and my sense of smell is just fine. If other people are complaining, I have a feeling the Yankee Candle Company has changed something in the way it adds the different fragrances to their candles, so now, they are less potent than they always have been. I want a candle that can fill my house with a delicious scent, not one that I have to keep trying to smell!

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Autumn Wreath",B000TVJ6XW,Lanie,"I've been purchasing Yankee Candle products (mainly candles) for over 20 years and can say without a doubt in my mind that it doesn't matter if you purchase from an authorized dealer or from the Yankee Candle website or in a corporate store, the majority of the time you aren't going to get much of a scent release from many of their candles when they are burning.  Their quality (or scent release) is just not even close what it used to be and that's a shame because they used to be the beast of candles when it came to scent.  If you are looking for a candle that has a lot of scent to it, Yankee is not the company to look at anymore and hasn't been for a while now. That said, I also think that this candle was worth the price that I paid for it.  I grabbed two of them for less than $10 each with free shipping.  That price changed how satisfied I am with the product and did effect my review rating and satisfaction level.  Hopefully that makes sense. Autumn Wreath does smell good when it is cold and the name fits the cold scent notes very well.  It really doesn't have much scent at all when it is lit.  I've had multiples of this one from a couple of different places that I caught on deep sale or clearance and not one performed better than any of the others. I placed this candle into a Yankee jar candle holder with the illuma lid hoping that the illuma lid would help because sometimes they do.  Unfortunately the extra heat that the illuma lid provides did not increase the scent release in this candle.  It just looks really pretty in the holder sitting on my kitchen counter. I will usually burn a candle that has a strong scent over by my stove at the same time so I have the ambiance of two candles burning but the scent of only one.  In an odd way, I actually like that I can practically count on Yankee to have zero scent release when burning so I can create a nice comfy look and feel, without multiple candles having a scent war that can give me a headache.  That is now the beauty of Yankee Candle and Autumn Wreath. All in all I think this candle is today's version of a typical Yankee Candle and that's why I gave it three stars.  It's a large candle that provides ambiance and looks pretty in a jar holder.  Nothing more, nothing less.",3.0,2019-02-04,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000TVJ6XW/?pageNumber=3

TL;DR: maybe I am not a candle connoisseur, but I was really expecting that all of the wax would burn with the wick. It does not - lots of left over wax along the walls of the jar. Also, scent although nice isn't very strong (maybe a plus for some folks). --- What are you supposed to get in return? A nice relaxing scent? I suppose so - but it's not that strong. Was hoping to use this to combat kitchen odor after cooking something... fragrant, but it's barely noticeable. Also, the wick burns too quickly and doesn't draw enough wax? I was expecting the heat from the flame would melt the wax, and the wick would draw the molten wax as fuel for the flame. That way as the wick goes down, so does the wax.

Before purchasing, I went to a Yankee Candle store in the local mall, to see if I'd like this newer version of the classic.  Now I can order online and not have to pay the full retail pricing.

There's just something about this particular candle that just makes you want to light it up, and curl up on the couch with a warm cup of cocoa or tea! It really is great! Despite all the other customers having issues with cracked glass or a melted candle, I had no issues with mine. The packaging was perfect--a lot of packing air bags were included so that it wouldnt break! I also think the fact that some people received melted candles were probably because they ordered them during periods in which the weather might have been a lot hotter--so i definitely recommend buying these candles from Amazon when the weather has cooled down a bit.",5.0,2017-10-22,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000TVJ6XW/?pageNumber=5

Hit us right in the face like a Yankee Candle normally does.  That was the end of that.  As soon as we lit it there was no smell at all.  Was lit for hours and the house just smelled like burnt wax.  2 of these burning in the house at the same time would normally make every floor in the house smell good.  Nope not these.  Disappointed in them.  Will be returning.  Seems pretty common based on the reviews not sure how people lucked out with good smelling ones and others didn't.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Autumn Wreath",B000TVJ6XW,New Jersey,"I keep going back to Yankee Candles every time!!! Amazon keeps very competitive pricing... better than Ebay!!  This candle I just received was a ""used"" product...not the candle itself but the outer boxing was damaged... to save like .79 cents, I got autumn candle from the ""used"" section, along with another Large candle. I have gotten 4 other used candles in the past.... never an issue, this one unusable...lol I will buy new, from here on out, the Autumn candles I've had before were all sooooo nice!!! Awesome throw, but not overpowering! Spicy, woodsy scent.... i burn them all year round!!!  So i guess my review is a heads up to what can happen sometimes.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Autumn Wreath",B000TVJ6XW,Joe,I'm a big fan of Yankee Candle and it's the only one's we burn in our home. Unlike cheaper candles from home stores these never leave soot on our surfaces. This specific candle has a great scent with a hint of cinnamon. It's strong and you can tell it's burning throughout the house.

There are other autumn-y scents for Yankee Candles, such as Autumn Wreaths, but my guests and I really do prefer this one - perhaps a little less sweet than the others, a bit more earthy. The medium candles, in my experience, burn more clearly and evenly than the other sizes, although that may have more to do with the shape and size of my living room, and the placement of our windows, than anything intrinsically pertaining to the jar-size.",5.0,2013-01-01,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000TVJ6XW/?pageNumber=30

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Mistletoe",B000CB4UQM,RUCTF,"For a Yankee Candle, and the price I paid, I was very disappointed. The smell was non-existent. I thought Yankee were once the best? Apparently greed must have killed them like it does so many businesses these days. You get people running the biz that want to start using cheaper quality materials to make more profit, and they raise prices to ridiculous levels because people love their products. Only they don‚Äôt realize people aren‚Äôt as stupid as they hoped. The people begin to realize that they just aren‚Äôt as good as they once were and they are WAY out of the ballpark now for the Quality to Cost ratio. So people try another brand and go wow, that‚Äôs a great candle! And they never go back. They then talk to their friends about it and the friends ‚Äúwake up‚Äù and go ‚Äúyour right, their candles just aren‚Äôt that great anymore. Their prices have gotten ridiculous anyway.‚Äù It is now that they switch too over to that other brand that really knows how to make a great smelling candle, that stays smelling great, until the last bit of life leaves the flame on the wicks. I know for a fact that this happens as stated above. It is from direct experiences on my part, multiple times as well. I even started polling our friends and the majority of them actually verified the same sentiment. That Yankee Candles, which used to be everyone‚Äôs favorite,  have gone downhill so badly and have gotten so crazy expensive, that it just does not make sense to keep wasting the amount of time I have to work to pay for them. I work hard. I want quality for my money and time. I‚Äôm not going to spend an hour working to throw away on garbage. Companies don‚Äôt respect the people who work to pay their salaries. The only thing they care about is my money and not the time I slaved at work just to purchase their crappy product. What happened to the days when ‚Äúcustomers come FIRST‚Äù? They‚Äôre gone and now it‚Äôs only about taking your money/time and passing it on to the fat executive that‚Äôs destroying their brand, just to make themselves and their greedy shareholders fatter and richer off the backs of those who do the REAL work in this world.... just for the privilege of buying their overpriced trinkets.",2.0,2020-01-31,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000CB4UQM/?pageNumber=1

Where I have the candles sitting is close to the HVAC units intake , and WOW,  when my heater kicks on it pulls the scent up through the system and makes my whole house smell like Christmas.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Mistletoe",B000CB4UQM,N&G,"I have had a Yankee Candle Mistletoe candle for nearly 7 years now. I have only lit it here and there during the month of December. I finally ran out of the candle and ordered a new one here on Amazon. At first I chickened out after reading some poor reviews of people having suspicions it's not real or that they're ""old"" with no scent (I don't think age stops these candles from having a scent...

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Mistletoe",B000CB4UQM,aman4allseasons,"One of my favorite scents I like to use during the holidays; A nice pine like and berry scent with a good throw to it. A great candle if you like to use other than a straight pine or fir scent. Suggestions Issue: Jar candles that don't burn evenly. Purchase (available online) waxed candle wicks with the base 6-8"" in length and a 12"" long drill bit around 11/64 Drill a hole offset of the main candle wick about 3/4-1"" clear to the bottom of jar. Detach base of purchased 6"" wick and insert into drilled hole and trim to same length as original wick; now you have a 2 wick candle which will burn more evenly. Suggestion When your jar candles wick has expired and there is that little bit of wax left. Place Jar on oven burner and melt wax over low-med heat. When melted remove old wick base with a fork and place another wick as mentioned above but do not detach from base. place in melted wax and you have a makings of a new candle and just melt wax from other used candles and pour into jar candle with the new wick. after about 6 + used candles you will have a new candle.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Mistletoe",B000CB4UQM,Zolton,"I'm not a big Christmas guy. If I find myself sitting on the knee of some fat bearded guy at the mall, telling him what I wish for most and whether I've been a naughty boy, then I've got a whole world of problems I really don't want to think about. Still, 'tis the season. So at my wife's insistence, I'm making an effort to find the ""Christmas spirit"" this year. Where by ""find"", of course I mean ""buy"". Mistletoe is an old Christmas standby, and romantic to boot. But who wants some hacked-off bit of poisonous plant looming over their doorway? Better, I thought, to bring the tradition home in candle form. I'm not usually so keen on the aromas of things that end in 'toe', but I have to say, this candle smells really nice and piney fresh. As mistletoe, it's another story. I tried angling for a smooch from my sweetie the other day, lifting the candle above our heads in the established mistletoe tradition. Sadly, the candle is rather heavy, and when I leaned in for a peck I accidentally dropped it on my own head. I thought I was getting a kiss, and instead I wound up on the floor bleeding from a head wound and trying to remember the name of the letter that comes after 'G'. And that doesn't spell ""Christmas"" in my book. More like ""junior prom"", from what I can recall. At least that came with a boutonniere and a flask full of Boone's Farm. Now all I've got is memory loss and this smelly green candle.",4.0,2011-12-06,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000CB4UQM/?pageNumber=14
"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Mistletoe",B000CB4UQM,Michael Taylor,"In all fairness, I must give an update.  Thought I'd take a chance and buy another Mistletoe candle today (October 24, 2013).  The scent seems to be a good deal stronger than the one I bought previously in 2008. Nice and sweet scent similar to a Christmas tree - dare say it's one of the closest to a Christmas Tree that Yankee Candle has.  My wife likes the candle, so it must be good! Upgrade to a four star - recommended. Earlier review: While other reveiwers have given this candle a 5-star rating, I have to give it a 3 mainly because the scent was too weak for me.  Personally, I like candles to pack some ""punch"" when they burn and Mistletoe, while a pleasant smelling candle, is not as strong as some of the other Yankee candle scents. The candle smells good while in the store and does smell okay when burning, but the scent is just a little too weak for me.  The scent is definitely piney, but could have been stronger (in my humble opinion). If you like a candle with a subtle piney scent, then this one's for you.  Otherwise, get another scent if you like something stronger.",4.0,2008-01-01,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000CB4UQM/?pageNumber=14
"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Mistletoe",B000CB4UQM,Jennifer Cox,"I was simply ""pining"" for real Christmas tree scent.  I bought this candle confident it would deliver, as most Yankee candles do, but this one was a dud.  It just doesn't put out any scent.  Today, I walked into my hair salon today and immediately smelled the most delicious Christmas tree fragrance.  I darted my head around looking for the cluprit, expecting to find a 13 foot fresh Frasier Fir near by when my eyes fell upon the source.  It was a Trapp White Fir candle.  The salon had stock there to sell and I snatched one up immediately.  Lit it when I got home, and as I sit here right now the heavenly scent is filling our home.

I'm also a huge fan of the Christmas season, so what a combo!  The Mistletoe scent brings to mind a slightly semi-sweet yet refreshing Christmas greenery and pine boughs combination.  Very ""Christmasy"", not overpowering! I make sure to stock up on these for Christmastime, and I give smaller jars as gifts to friends. I have tried many other brands of candles meant to scent up whole rooms, and none come close to Yankee Candle in quality.  I have a very sensitive sense of smell, and most other brands are either too weak, or are so overpowering as to make one nauseous! Yankee Candle gets it ""just right"" every time.

Several times I tried to call and couldn't even get through- got a busy signal or a recording saying the wait would be over 30 minutes!!

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Strawberry Lemon Ice,B019PN2DX4,Maria Robin Estes,"I ordered 2 of these candles which were sold by the same company. They were shipped and arrived on different days. I‚Äôm still trying to understand why. Both candles were shipped poorly. The 1st had the top tapped as if done by an elementary student and thrown in a box. The 2nd appeared to have been taped, but somehow the top became detached and it was shipped in an envelope. What I noticed upon opening the envelope was lack of fragrance. I cleaned away the tape and decided to light the candle and burn for a couple of hours. I was extremely dissatisfied. There was a very faint fragrance and the candle began to burn straight down the center. I‚Äôve purchased this candle in the past. I know how beautiful the fragrance is or should be and these candles last for a long time. The candle that I‚Äôve been using in my bathroom was purchased in November 2019 and while I don‚Äôt burn it every day. It is still very fragrant and after a year still has quite a bit of burn time left. My Plan was to gift one of these candles to a friend for her Birthday but due to the tacky wrapping, it simply is not presentable!! Poor quality and presentation for the Cost.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Strawberry Lemon Ice,B019PN2DX4,Valentina,"I don't know, I didn't find this scent as enjoyable as so many expressed.  I was looking for a fresh, energizing scent.  This was not it at all.  It's not bad, but it is a bit muted. You don't really smell cilantro, but I also don't quite get a pineapple scent.  It smells like a stronger version of a glade candle, to be honest.  It is not a bad scent, but it is not something one expects from Yankee.  It is long lasting and it does drown out kitchen cooking smells, so that's why I still gave it 2 stars .",2.0,2018-10-21,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B019PN2DX4/?pageNumber=2

If you sign up for the PAPER catalog from Yankee that STILL comes in the snail mail you'll get coupons for B.O.G.O. Free on the large jar candles.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Strawberry Lemon Ice,B019PN2DX4,Toby Moore,"This was purchased as a small Valentine's gift for my wife.  I had bought her a Lemon Verbena candle (different brand) for Christmas, which smelled really nice.  But then we noticed the terrible black soot it left on her home office walls and ceiling...so much for buying another.  She's had dozens of Yankee candles over the years with no issues, and this one was ""Amazon's Choice"" so I went for it.  Simply put, this jar missed the fragrance nozzle on the assembly line.  We're talking basically no lemon, unless you concentrate it in a very small location.  And even then you have to practically singe your eyebrows off leaning into it to smell anything.  Nothing like other Yankee stuff in the past.  Production mistake?  Yankee's new cost-cutting philosophy?  Who knows.  Just $17 wasted.  We'll go back to generic candles bought at the supermarket.  They may not burn quite as long, but they have 20 times the fragrance and cost about a third as much.",1.0,2021-02-18,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B019PN2DX4/?pageNumber=2

I however don't, and got this candle only out of the ""cilantro"" curiosity which I don't understand what is doing on the label at all. The scent is pleasant and I will burn it since it is very enjoyable, it is somewhat ""thick"", sweet, tropical with a lot of pineapple to it. Reminds me of my Oahu vacation :) The scent is pretty prominent, not the most fragrant of other Yankees that I have, but I would rate it as medium on the fragrant scale. A good choice for someone who gets headaches from strong overwhelming scents. As other Yankees this lasts forever, I have used it quiet a few times now, and it is almost full (see the picture).

What I do smell when I burn it, is a smell identical to the smell I experience when I cut up a fresh, ripe, very sweet pineapple. That scent is very predominant in this candle. I also smell sweet coconut, but heavier on the pineapple. It's a perfect balance, and definitely a sweet smell, though not at all in a bad way. When I burn it, the throw is strong. I'd say a 7.5 or so, and it fills my room wonderfully. I can't recommend this one enough.

Right now, 3+ hours of burn time, and it is pretty much just a red, unscented jar candle. I'll keep it for power outages but as far as scenting the house, I suggest Red Apple Wreath - soft apples and cloves (I think. It is definitely not cinnamon - so I'm thinking cloves).

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Strawberry Lemon Ice,B019PN2DX4,Barbara Elyse,I've never been to Sicily or found any Sicilian Lemons in the produce department to know for sure how close the scent is to the real thing - but the scent was not anything like the fresh zesty scent of a lemon - sorta cloying sweet - this was one time when I wished the scent was not strong - thankfully it was not so strong to fill the house but not a scent I will purchase again !,3.0,2021-06-15,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B019PN2DX4/?pageNumber=6

I am so grateful and happy that I found Passion-fruit Martini. This fragrant masterpiece is staying with me forever! I would rate the fragrance strength 5 out of five! The scent is somewhat similar to Coconut Guava Fusion, but is twice more fragrant, and much richer with a greater depth of sophistication and a play of under-tones in the scent. Along with Chocolate Layer Cake (love also) and Salted Caramel (not in love) , this is one of the most fragrant Yankee collection that I own.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Strawberry Lemon Ice,B019PN2DX4,Tirzah Price,"I'm such a fan of the fragrance! It's sweet and exotic, and so relaxing. It's not overbearing and it doesn't get too strong or sickly-sweet smelling when the candle is burning, which is an issue I have with many cheaper candles I buy. The 22 oz. jar is nice and big, and the packaging boasts over 100 hours of burn time, which I can attest to. I lit this one 2-5 hours a day for over 5 weeks before it burnt out. My only complaint would be that I still have probably a half of an inch of wax in the bottom of the jar, but my wick is completely burnt. This could be be due to the fact that I had to blow it out at one point, and if I had kept burning it, the wax would have been used up completely. Otherwise, this is a wonderful product--pineapple and cilantro aren't two scents you'd think to combine, but they're fantastic together! At $25, it's a little bit pricey for a candle, but this is a big jar and it really does last, so it's well worth the money!",5.0,2011-05-10,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B019PN2DX4/?pageNumber=8

"Yankee Candle Belgian Waffles, The Sunday Brunch Collection, Classic Glass Jar Candles, Large 7 Inches, 22 OZ",B07QYB6R2Q,mommacass83,"UPDATE: I have received the 2nd candle, and it is in good condition, so I have increased my rating and added photos of the 2nd candle. I still think the packages should have been labeled as ""keep cool"" or something.  Please note: the original candle did not sit out on my front porch for more than 2 minutes after it was delivered, and was already solid when I opened the package - so it definitely was melted in transit. Original review: I ordered two of these candles on Amazon, since Yankee Candle didn't seem to have it on their site anymore. Perhaps it was my mistake to order a candle during the summer, but the first of two candles arrived like this (see images). I will try melting it down and remaking it, but I wish the candle had been shipped with instructions for the carrier to keep this package cool. Oh well.

Yankee Candle Maple Pancakes Large Jar Candle,B003U2J4XY,Mitri,"My parents being from upstate New York, I grew up in a household obsessed with maple.  We had to have real maple syrup on our pancakes--none of that Mrs. Butterworth's nonsense.  I inevitably became a maple connoisseur, as we discussed whether those so-called ""maple"" cookies were ""maple-y"" enough.  When I found this Maple candle, I was quite excited by the prospect but afraid to be let down.  Let me assure you--you will not be let down if you love the sweet smell of maple sugar!  Recently I forgot to put the lid back on my jar, and when I came home from work I asked my significant other, ""Did you bake something?  It smells delicious.""  Soon after I realized that the sweet, heavenly scent was simply wafting from the unlit, open candle.

It was placed in my bedroom and you could smell it all the way in the basement. Very strong and fragrant. Another great quality about this candle is that it has a long burning life. I let this burn from 9 AM until 10 PM today and it only used up a tiny portion of the candle. Yankee Candle is a bit expensive but well worth it, as their candles last long and are of high quality. I definitely recommend this scent, especially for the upcoming fall season! It makes me want to stay inside all day!",5.0,2011-09-09,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B003U2J4XY/?pageNumber=2

Yankee Candle Christmas Cookie Large Jar Candle,B0155OG8LK,G.W.,"The media could not be loaded. Very pleased! I bought the box of 12 candles a couple of weeks ago and it sat on the dining room table until today.  The unburned candles gave off a very pleasant aromatic scent in the dining room, just sitting there.  I finally opened the box today to give one a test. For the test, I lit the candle and placed it in a small amber glass punch bowl cup.  The candle was then placed on a shelf where I could keep an eye on it through the day.  (See picture.) I timed when I lit it (9:38am) and when it went out (2:31pm).  Elapsed time was therefore 4 hours and 53 minutes. I also took a 3-second video at about 3-1/2 hours into the test.  As you can see, there was a gentle draft in the room, but the flame was mostly protected from air currents.  I suspect that other reviewers who complain of short burn times either have the candle in a low-walled tealight holder where the flame is exposed to air currents, or place the candle in significant drafts (central heating or ac, or outdoors).  Drafty areas can dramatically shorten a candle‚Äôs burn time. The smell was rich and warm, without being too cloying.  It was a fairly faithful rendition of ‚ÄúChristmas cookies‚Äù scent, though no burning candle (or tobacco, or incense, or pine needles)  ends up smelling exactly like its original fragrance, since burning essential oils is very different from simply heating them to diffuse the oils. I‚Äôm quite happy with these candles.  Almost a 5-hour burn time and a pleasant scent ‚Äî pretty much exactly as advertised.  Based on this experience, I ordered a box of Yankee Candles patchouli tealight candles to try them out, too.",5.0,2019-03-02,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0155OG8LK/?pageNumber=1

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle French Vanilla,B000W3T9GG,David S. Young,"I don‚Äôt know why Yankee Candles chose to dramatically reduce, or at times eliminate the scent in their candles. They were reknown for consistently strong scents, that wafted throughout your home, but no longer. I purchased 20 for gifts last Christmas, and no aroma at all could be smelled in 11 of them. Too late to buy other gifts or return them. I had them wrapped and distributed. I still feel guilty. Many Companies risk quality when mass produced for Amazon. I‚Äôll never buy another, anywhere. Without vigilent quality control batch testing, a manufacturer often goes bankrupt. Amazon must educate and inspect quality measures consistently, lest they sale garbage.

It's absolutely wonderful to light about 20 minutes before I have my morning cup of coffee. There's just something special about the background of baking cookies while sipping coffee. My husband loves it too. Whenever he walks into room he says ""that candle smells so good!"" It arrived on Wednesday and I've been burning it every day. It's about half used. Not bad. Like other single-wick candles, the wax often needs to be scraped down the side otherwise a cavernous hole develops down the middle around the wick.

Maybe it's an online scam, like it's a regular candle and they slap on a yankee label. The other candles, that actually have a scent, I bought at Bed Bath & Beyond.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle French Vanilla,B000W3T9GG,Vicki,"Yankee candles have been my favorite for more than 20 years. When I saw this great price, I jumped on it!  Now I am glad I only ordered one. It smelled wonderful until it got around the midway point. Now that it is half burned, I can barely smell the fragrance unless I lean over the top and really concentrate. It has been burning on an end table right next to me for the past two hours and nothing, no fragrance. So disappointing.  This candle is still long burning as are all Yankee candles, and it does not put out an off-putting waxy odor, but I will not buy this again.",3.0,2020-11-20,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000W3T9GG/?pageNumber=2

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle French Vanilla,B000W3T9GG,Karina-Oh!,"I was expecting a ""slightly damaged"" product, as that's how this Yankee Candle was listed when I purchased it. It was a French Vanilla large jar candle, reduced in price from Amazon Warehouse. I figured that for the discounted price, I could deal with that. My candle arrived today, a couple of days early, which was nice. When I opened the box and inspected the contents, it was in pristine condition! The box and the protective enclosure inside was a little damaged, but that was it. So, I'm a happy camper with this purchase! I've purchased a couple of things through the warehouse and have never been disappointed, so I make it a habit to always check the warehouse before I make my purchase.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle French Vanilla,B000W3T9GG,Andre,"Great scent if you love birthday cake. Unfortunately everyone goes nose blind to scents after a while of being in the vicinity of a scent and after those few first glorious minutes of being in a room with this candle lit, you won't even notice the smell. That is ... until you walk out the room to so something (whether to go to the kitchen, bathroom, etc) and return to the room. Then the soothing smell of fresh birthday cake returns for a few minutes. Nose blindness is no fault of the candle. Just our stupid noses üò† Anyways I used this candle beyond what was recommended and had no issues. Do so at your own risk but I did use the candle until all the wax was nearly completely burned out. I've lit, put out, and relit this candle multiple times with no issue. So long as the bottom of the glass isn't getting hot there shouldn't be a risk of the candle and glass exploding. But then again, what do I know? Do so at your own risk but I just could not allow myself to stop using this candle once the wax reached below half. It smelled too good to waste. Also this candle is very aesthetically pleasing in a room. It blends in and the fire burning inside the glass jar just looks elegant.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle French Vanilla,B000W3T9GG,SUE-ELLEN DAVISON,"Yankee Candle's primary claim to fame was always their marvelous scents. This Salted Caramel ""scented"" candle has none. The only scent you'll detect is if you stick your nose into the jar before lighting. Yes, there's a scent there, but no matter how long you burn it, you're never going to get to enjoy Salted Caramel or any other scent wafting about your room. It's just not there. And yes, my sense of smell is still good, thank you for asking. Also, the Yankee Candle makers, like all candle makers, used to know how to gauge the thickness of their wicks so that they burned down at the same rate that the wax melted. The company has stopped concerning themselves with that nicety since they've decided it's really their customers' job to constantly trim the wicks. If you overlook that, next thing you know, a six-inch flame will be shooting out of the jar threatening to crack it and/or set your curtains or something else on fire. Yankee Candle has evidently lost interest in selling a quality product. That might be all right if they had the decency to reduce their prices accordingly because their new product is  only worth the price of the jar. That, at least, can be used for something.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle French Vanilla,B000W3T9GG,Matt Wallenstein,"I like to burn candles in my apartment because I find that freshening sprays don't always last as long as I would like, and incense is just too strong and invasive for me to want to use it consistently. Yankee's salted caramel scent is probably my favorite one so far. It is extremely sweet-smelling as you would expect, but it is not sickeningly sweet like I was worried it would be. It almost reminds me of bread baking or fresh cookies. It is a very warm and soothing smell that I would not necessarily describe as subtle because it will definitely fill up a room, but it is not overpowering and becomes part of the scenery. I got the Bahama Breeze scent along with this, and while I like that one, the scent is not nearly as strong as this one and is much less noticeable. I would be cautious of giving this as a gift to someone because I could see some thinking it is overly sweet. I don't think it is, but I like sweet scents so I may have a higher tolerance than some people.

I keep the wicks trimmed on all my candles and even doing that, the scent throw with this one can only be described as very weak.  It was used in a 12 x 12 bedroom so it should have filled the room with vanilla scent and it just didn't deliver.  I bought this one because it was $9.00 cheaper here than company's website so I thought it would be a good deal.  The Walmart brand vanilla bean throws more scent than this candle did.  I love French Vanilla Yankee Candles but am on the fence whether or not this one is authentic so I won't be buying it here again.

When burned in a smaller room, such as a bedroom, I find it to be overwhelming and just can not let it burn. When burned in a larger, more open area such as open floor plan kitchen/dining room/family room area, it's perfect. Bit of a scent, but not overpowering.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle French Vanilla,B000W3T9GG,Papaia,So.. I ordered the large jar french vanilla and got pink sands instead. I cant really complain because I was planning to try pink sands out after french vanilla and it was like $11 off. Pink sands is a pretty good smelling candle to the point I would probably want to smell like this candle everyday. It also would be good as a bathroom candle when you're taking a bath or wanna get rid of a bad smell.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Sage & Citrus,B000RY54LO,Providential,"This is one of the few scents in the Yankee line that I'd say is totally compatible with someone looking for a ""masculine"" scent. To me this candle smells of musk and sandalwood and just a hint of citrus. Perfect for a man, but great for anyone. At one point in my life this was the exact scent I wanted for my home- plus just a hint of cherry tobacco smell to round out the nose. Every time I came home the smell of the place lifted my spirits. Smells clean, herbal, citrus-y, and not too ""plastic-y"" or floral like I'm finding a lot of other candles to smell nowadays.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Sage & Citrus,B000RY54LO,Laura,"My candle arrived broken. It was packed in a loose bubble wrap bag and put in a HUGE box with lots of that annoying bubble inflated packaging stuff Amazon uses that doesn't do a bit of good. The lid og the canlde was not secured in any way. It came loose. The edge of the lid and all around the top of the candle was shattered into little slivers and glass dust. The bubble bag had broken and the slivers and dust was all over inside the box and came out all over me, the couch and the carpet. The loose bubble wrap bag had holes in it and provided no protection and didn't contain the broken glass. I got online to report it broken and get a replacement. I found no way to contact the 3rd party seller, and when I went through the online refund system, i was told I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR RETURN SHIPPING to the seller to get a replacement and that an automatic refund is not avaiable. I would have to handle this hazardous broken glass item, repackage it, and pay for shipping in order to get a replacement. I paid 35 dollars for this candle, and now I not only have to deal with the mess, I have to pay out of my own pocket to fix it. Unacceptable. The only good piece of luck was that this item was for me and not for a christmas gift.

I also am buying one for my home as well for when I have guests over. This product only gets 4 star review (even with a great scent), because the candle jar arrived broken.  The first candle shipped to me on time, but when we opened the box the glass jar was broken into pieces.  I think it was due to the shipping company.  Thankfully, the Amazon Sellers replaced the product immediately and were not difficult to deal with at all.  They made it quite easy as well.  I would have expected it to be harder since I bought it as a gift, and the receiver of my gift was the one that requested a new candle. The ease of dealing with the replacement process (if needed), and the quality of the product is what brought my review back to 4 stars.",4.0,2012-06-12,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000RY54LO/?pageNumber=9

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Sage & Citrus,B000RY54LO,Sharon Beverly,"This is my 'go-to' candle when I need to relax.  Aromatherapy can be invigorating or calming and this fragrance is very soothing.  I've smelled sage in other candles and found them to be harsh.  This one isn't.  There's just enough citrus mixed with it to make it refreshing.  Think of the scent as a soft, powdery sage with notes of citrus. While Yankee Candles are not inexpensive, they do last far longer than any others I've bought.  They burn right down to the very bottom of the jar and the scent is as true as when you first lit the wick of your new jar. We live in a home with an open floor plan.  Being such a large space, you might expect the candle to scent just a limited area.  Pleasantly, that's not the case.  After about 45 minutes of use, the aroma wafts throughout the entire space.  And while strong enough to do that, it doesn't have an overpowering effect, either. Light your candle, listen to relaxing music, and you'll feel calm within minutes.",5.0,2011-12-16,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000RY54LO/?pageNumber=24
Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Sage & Citrus,B000RY54LO,strangefable,"I wouldn't normally have purchased this scent, but I have consistently loved every Yankee Candle I've ever had, so when a lightning deal came up with a great price, I decided to give it a go. I was hesitant, because it definitely doesn't sound like a combo I'd want in my house, but it's actually quite lovely and mellow. As with all Yankee Candles, it diffuses wonderfully, without being overpowering or too weak, and burns consistently well, but the sage and citrus scents seem to balance really well. Neither one drowns out the other. It's a more masculine scent than I'd usually buy, but I'm finding it refreshing. I'll definitely be buying this one again!",5.0,2017-02-17,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000RY54LO/?pageNumber=24
Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Sage & Citrus,B000RY54LO,Mom of 5,"Every Yankee candle I've ever had has degraded into a stinky smokey mess by the time it is half burned. No matter how much I like the scent when it is new, the quality is a dangerous and unacceptable mess as It is burned down.  They are not cheap so it is disheartening to discard so much of it.  I don't buy them anymore for this reason.  I do receive them as gifts and sometimes use a melter to avoid the extreme smokiness.  This citrus sage is nice, if you don't burn it more than a third or so.  I pretty much just keep these for emergencies.",1.0,2017-07-11,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000RY54LO/?pageNumber=24
Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Sage & Citrus,B000RY54LO,Michael Taylor,"The Yankee Candle ""Sage and Citrus"" scent is an excellent blend of sage and a touch of lemon-lime.  In my humble opinion, the candle smelled great in the unused condition and has a pleasant aroma when burning. My only complaint is that the candle could have been a little stronger.  The scent is great but you need to burn the candle a little longer to get the aroma throughout your room or house. Complaint aside, still a good candle, particularly if you like citrus scents.

It's got the soft, slightly pungent, woody scent of sage and the clean scent of citrus in a perfect combination. I'd call this an all-season scent: it captures the scents of a spring and summer herb garden as well as the scents of the fruits and herbs of the fall and winter holidays. It's also equally appealing to both sexes; I gave it as a gift to our parish priest, who often burns candles, and he loved it.

We all agree that this is awful.  I can't even tell one of them to burn it in their own rooms, they won't take it.  Just having to take a couple more whiffs of it to write this review was painful.  I don't know if it's the lemon that is ruining it for me or the sage, but something about it just kills it for me and I can't stand it.
