Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Balsam & Cedar,B000JDGC78,David Beblo,I bought the Balsam & Cedar for the Christmas Season. It does smell nice when I walk past it but otherwise you'd never know that there was a lit candle in the room. My whole house is only 1084 square feet. I used to be able to smell a REAL Yankee Candle throughout the house. Not Anymore! Ever since Yankee Candle was sold their candles are no better than Dollar Tree candles. It's a shame.,1.0,2021-12-06,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000JDGC78/?pageNumber=12,negative

"Yankee Candle Large Jar, Christmas Cookie",B000C2TB6U,Lauren,I bought two of these candles. You can tell they’re old. They have practically no smell at all. As someone who used to work for Yankee Candle I’m extremely displeased. These candles are expensive and you want quality with what you’re paying for. This is not it. I suggest taking your money to your nearest ALDI and buying a 3 wick Huntington Home candle for 5 dollars that is better quality than this.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Balsam & Cedar,B000JDGC78,Jeanne Smith,"Below is my review. I read an article (Avery Hartmans/Business Insider) that stated the lack of smell with this candle is due to COVID. Mr. Hartmans generalization is unfounded. I have Village Candles that I can smell just fine and have no issues tasting or smelling what I eat or drink. When will we stop blaming everything on COVID?!? The candle has one wick and is very pretty. There is zero scent when burning the candle. I purchased one for us and another to give as a gift. The lack of scent when being burned, I will donate the second one.
