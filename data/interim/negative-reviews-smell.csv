"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Mediterranean Breeze,1521678Z,Blue",B01MTS599T,Daniadiaz7,I received my candle today; as soon as I open the box everything inside was covered in blue. The bubble wrap was completely sticky and blue. Once I open the jar I noticed the wick appears to be black which makes me think it was used. The top also doesn't fit properly. Was this a damage product that I am being charged basically full price for?!? This was intended as a gift but there is no way I can gift a used candle. I thought about returning the product but didn't want to deal with labels and ups and all the extra stuff I thought I was avoiding from ordering online. I really upset because the candle smells great if it wasn't for the damage product I would have given this 5 stars.,2.0,2014-04-25,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01MTS599T/?pageNumber=29,negative

"Yankee Candle Large Jar, Christmas Cookie",B000C2TB6U,CTaylor,"I have been buying Yankee candles for 20 years. Ordered 2 Yankee candles and both came today. This particular one ""Christmas Cookie"" appears to be a fake! I'm 99% positive. The bottom of the jar doesn't have the ""normal"" Yankee candle sticker. Also it smells like a cheap vanilla sent from the dollar store. There is very little smell. You can also tell that it was poured very smoothly. Yankee candles are not smooth like that and have waxy oily fragrant bubbles in them! I have never been so disappointed. Definitely will never order from this seller again. I paid way to much money for this candle, for it to smell so cheap! I know what Christmas cookies Yankee candles smell like and this isn't it!!! I'm a stay at home mom so I don't get out often but lesson learned. So so disappointed! :(",1.0,2015-07-02,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000C2TB6U/?pageNumber=18,negative
Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Spiced Pumpkin,B000W3V8S8,Jane,"Never written a review before and never had a problem with Amazon but the candle that came is NOT the spiced pumpkin that's pictured.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Balsam & Cedar,B000JDGC78,Josh scritchfield,"This is my first negative review. When I received the candle and opened the lid to the candle it smelled good, but after lighting it and letting it burn for a couple days 2-3 hours preferably each time. The candle has no smell to it at all and I mean at all!!! so I was confused and maybe thought it was my nose or something is wrong. so I asked several people that have come over to smell after I lit it and they said they do not smell it either so I would not waste my money on this sorry but definitely not worth the money!! A $4 dollar candle at Walmart smells better than this",2.0,2017-11-16,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000JDGC78/?pageNumber=17,negative

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Red Apple Wreath",B001U40C6W,bettygarcia,"I have been burning Yankee candles for years.  There is something wrong with this Red Apple Wreath candle.  From day one, it sputtered and sizzled when I tried to light the wick; like there is water in the candle.  I persisted, because I do like the smell, but it hasn't gotten better.  Oftentimes the candle puts itself out. leaving an unpleasant smoke pervading the air.  When I trim the wick, necessary to prevent black smoke when it gets too long, it starts up with the sputtering again when I try to light it.  I've tried putting the candle under a warmer to melt the wax, to pour out some of the wax, to elongate the wick.  This has been a fruitless process.  I've ended up pouring half of the candle out, trying to get it to burn properly.  At this point, the wick is too long.  Black smoke pours off of it when lit.  I'm afraid to trim it anymore, in fear that I'll have to pour out even more of what little is left of the wax.  I am very disappointed in this candle.  I wonder if it is truly a Yankee candle.",1.0,2019-02-13,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B001U40C6W/?pageNumber=2,negative

Cinnamon Roll Scented Candles for Home | Non Toxic Long Lasting Soy Candles | Delicious Scent | Large 16 oz Mason Jar | Hand Made in The USA,B07WDYMGZN,Austin Lautenbach,"I rarely if ever write amazon reviews but this is likely one of my most disappointing items I've ever purchased. I recently ran out of my B&BW 20oz pumpkin candle which I loved, but I thought I'd try a smaller brand for a change. I was very disappointed for the following reasons: - the candle lacks any scent other than a faint smoke. I used it in a small 8x10 room with no external windows opened and I was unable to smell any difference at all, even from 2 feet away - the candle does not burn effectively and went out on me multiple times. I followed the lighting instructions to the T meaning cutting the wick to the correct length, cleaning out any debris, and always burning within the reccomended time limit. I still had it go out multiple times - this candle has severe tunneling issues. I think the wick might be too small for the diameter of the jar, because my candle melted out the inside only and left thick wax walls around the edges. Again, this was all while following the correct use instructions - the candle is tiny for its price. I realize it is listed as 8oz so I was expecting it to be small, but in light of the other problems listed above this seems an unacceptable price to size ratio. You can easily get 18 or 20 oz candles on this site that are better. Overall, I am disappointed and would not recommend this product to anyone. You're probably better off burning a generic unscented wax candle as it will give you the same effect and probably won't go out as much.",1.0,2021-01-25,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07WDYMGZN/?pageNumber=3,negative

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Macintosh,B007FSDIJA,Toby Moore,"This was purchased as a small Valentine's gift for my wife.  I had bought her a Lemon Verbena candle (different brand) for Christmas, which smelled really nice.  But then we noticed the terrible black soot it left on her home office walls and ceiling...so much for buying another.  She's had dozens of Yankee candles over the years with no issues, and this one was ""Amazon's Choice"" so I went for it.  Simply put, this jar missed the fragrance nozzle on the assembly line.  We're talking basically no lemon, unless you concentrate it in a very small location.  And even then you have to practically singe your eyebrows off leaning into it to smell anything.  Nothing like other Yankee stuff in the past.  Production mistake?  Yankee's new cost-cutting philosophy?  Who knows.  Just $17 wasted.  We'll go back to generic candles bought at the supermarket.

I truly hope it's not Amazon coming up with that lame excuse for their candles having no smell....I can tell you that I did not have Covid while burning their candle....MY CANDLE THAT I PURCHASED HAD NO SCENT UNLESS I WAS SUPER CLOSE TO IT. I KNOW I DIDNT HAVE COVID BECAUSE AFTER LIGHTING ONE OF MY OTHER CHEAP CANDLES, AFTER BEING DISAPPOINTED WITH THE YANKEE CANDLE, I WAS VERY MUCH ABLE TO SMELL IT JUST FINE!!

I read an article (Avery Hartmans/Business Insider) that stated the lack of smell with this candle is due to COVID. Mr. Hartmans generalization is unfounded. I have Village Candles that I can smell just fine and have no issues tasting or smelling what I eat or drink. When will we stop blaming everything on COVID?!? The candle has one wick and is very pretty. There is zero scent when burning the candle. I purchased one for us and another to give as a gift. The lack of scent when being burned, I will donate the second one.
