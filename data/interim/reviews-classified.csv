20,Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Home Sweet Home,B000WUFVR0,Renee,"I've been a Yankee Candle addict for well over 15 years, and this scent, ""Home Sweet Home,"" is the only one I use year-round! This purchase was delivered a day early and is a REAL Yankee Candle, not fake (believe me, I would know immediately if they were). People have asked me why I always buy the Yankee Candle brand? Because they're more expensive than others. I explain to them that I have bought other ""knockoffs"" to save money before, only to end up getting exactly what I paid for...wasted wax without any scent at the last 1/3 to 1/4 of the jar üòí, so they didn't save me anything. I don't work for the company, but I am a stickler for being well informed, so I know why the Yankee Candles cost more than their competitors... See, other companies only use their scented wax at the top 3/4 or 1/2 of their candle products, the bottom is just colored wax with a hint of scent. This way, they are able to trick the average customer into buying them. Don't get me wrong, at first, they all have great ""throw,"" however, as they burn down, their scent becomes much weaker. Some brands don't even use wicks long enough for their candles, causing them to fizzle out long before they should. Yankee Candle Company uses fully scented wax throughout the entire candle. They also have a high concentration of scented oils, to insure a strong throw of scent, from the first time you light it until it burns all the way down. *** P. S. Make sure you buy the REAL THING, not a cheap knockoff. I noticed that the complaints here are all about the ""Cinnamon Sparkle"" scent. Even though they're listed under the ""Home Sweet Home"" one. I ordered 2 of the ""Home Sweet Home"" scent here, and they're real Yankee Candle brand. If you get a fake one, like some of the other customers, report it to Amazon immediately! Amazon is just a distributor. They'll accept a return, even if your candle is burned to the wick, refund your money, then investigate to persecute the dirty posers!***",5.0,2021-07-02,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive
21,Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Home Sweet Home,B000WUFVR0,Just sayin'..,"I have had this scent for almost 20 years, give it take. The last one I had was bought about 5ish years ago and cycled seasonly with other Yankee Candles. It definitely always had a cinnamon smell but not like this. This one is almost satirical! This Home Sweet Home candle has such an exaggerated cinnamon smell, it burns the throat to smell it! You'll notice I made a point to let it be known I haven't bought a HSH Yankee candle in about 5 years. I did that incase Yankee has changed the formula to increase the Cinnamon. Or maybe it was a mistake buying on Amazon? Maybe it's a second? Or maybe I am just getting old and my olfactory glands are 'going' first? The only problem with the latter is the previous HSH candle I had was at it's wicks end and I was able to compare. So if it's my olfactory senses, they went haywire overnight. Yankee offers candles with Cinnamon in the name to let it be known cinnamon is what you're going to get. Wow, if they are more 'cinnamony' than this, it would double as a tear gas agent. Just imagine putting a Yankee cinnamon candle on a warmer during the holidays. One could clear out any family or friend visitors from sheer discomfort alone! This HSH is more than half way there. One could use this to politely clear any guests out of the home. It's just too much!",2.0,2021-12-19,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

I noticed it filled my entire bedroom with fragrance within only 20 minutes, which isn't typical for Yankee Candle nowadays.

Because it smells so spicey, I would recommend using it in a kitchen, breakfast room or dining room. I bought this to give to someone for a housewarming gift because the name of the candle is Home Sweet Home. I was very happy with the way this candle was packaged. It was wrapped very well in a shell of fitted cardboard and then boxed. It was delivered quickly and was completely intact, which is great because the candle is in a glass jar. I think this candle was too expensive, but I think all Yankee Candles are too expensive.

My entire house smells like the inside of a box of Red Hots candies. Other people complain about there being no scent, so maybe there is some sort of issue with consistency in these candles, but let me tell you, the one I have has my house absolutely reeking of spicy cinnamon. I dont really like the smell but the price was so cheap that I gave it a shot thinking 'it's probably not that strong of a smell'. Man was I wrong.

Even so, they burned down the middle like cheap candles.  I had to scrap the wax off the sides to fill in the cavern. That helped somewhat build the sides, but the wick is spent.  Huge waste of money. They smell great and look great until you start using them. Reviews on the Yankle Candle website show the same poor quality feedback.

However, my experience mirrors that of numerous other reviews: this candle is the weakest Yankee Candle I've ever smelled.  With every other Yankee Candle, after one is lit, I can smell it throughout the entire house.  With this one, the only way I can smell it is if I bend down over the candle and take a deep whiff while it's burning. I've never had a problem with Yankee Candle's QC before.

The candle needs to rest and reset for it to last that long. I'm not impressed by the scent, but then again, I much prefer earthy or floral scents over food or spice flavored scents.  So vanilla cupcake, cinnamon stick, cookie dough or other such nonsense is not my thing in a candle.  By far my favorite is Yankee's Balsam and Fir. Now that's a candle!  Lavender? YES.

I splurged on this one since it is Christmas season. I love the Christmas smell of balsam and the spicy scent of cloves. This candle has very little scent (had scent the first time I burned it but that has faded out) and what it has smells more like baby powder. Absolutely no clove scent at all and no balsam scent either.

465,Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Spiced Pumpkin,B000W3V8S8,Kyle H,"During pretty much any time of year I'm burning candles. I've burned cheaper ones like ""American home"" or ""village candle"" and I've burned nicer one's like ""yankee"" or ""kringle"". The cheaper candles are always faster burning and less fragrant. It's worth it to get a decent candle. Unless you REALLY want a specific (usually seasonal) scent, don't pay more than around 18$ for one of these. I've seen a bunch on here for like 25$+ and at that cost you're better off ordering kringle or some ""artisan"" brand. For 18ish bucks this candle is fantastic. This specific scent has lasted longer than some others, in that everyday I light it I can still smell it despite burning it for a week. Your nose and sense of smell is logarithmic (like your other senses) and after you have been exposed to the same smell for long enough, your brain stops recognizing it as unique and potent to your environment. It helps to buy several scents and rotate between them.",5.0,2020-10-19,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

I've gotten in the habit of doing this when I'm looking for a Yankee Candle. I found a Spiced Pumpkin large jar candle just a couple of days ago that was reduced to $13.39. So I decided to give it a shot. All of my past experiences have been good and this one was no exception! It arrived 1 full day early & it was very carefully packed. Upon opening, the jar was in excellent condition. Everything about the candle is authentic Yankee quality. However, when I removed the glass lid I saw that the wick was slightly singed, yet none of the wax surrounding it had been melted. Sort of like it had been lit and immediately blown out. It wasn't intended to be a gift; but if it was it wasn't giftable, so I rated it only 1 star for that category. I lit my candle and in a few seconds, no one was the wiser, lol...

I finally decided several years ago that I would only buy Yankee candles and stop wasting my money on the other brands, since I am always disappointed with them. I was thrilled when I found my favorite Cranberry Chutney jar candle available on Amazon a couple of weeks before Christmas. However, as I have burned it over the past several days, I have been extremely disappointed. My house used to be filled with the delicious aroma from this candle, but this time, I can barely smell it. I have heard the excuse that people are complaining about Yankee candles' scents this year due to a loss of smell from Covid-19. That is not the case with me, because I have not contracted covid, and my sense of smell is just fine. If other people are complaining, I have a feeling the Yankee Candle Company has changed something in the way it adds the different fragrances to their candles, so now, they are less potent than they always have been. I want a candle that can fill my house with a delicious scent, not one that I have to keep trying to smell!

Maybe they are hit or miss but usually everytime I've ever bought a Yankee Candle directly from the store itself the scent was always really strong when they were burning.,1.0,2021-09-28,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

I had bought her a Lemon Verbena candle (different brand) for Christmas, which smelled really nice.  But then we noticed the terrible black soot it left on her home office walls and ceiling...so much for buying another.  She's had dozens of Yankee candles over the years with no issues, and this one was ""Amazon's Choice"" so I went for it.  Simply put, this jar missed the fragrance nozzle on the assembly line.  We're talking basically no lemon, unless you concentrate it in a very small location.  And even then you have to practically singe your eyebrows off leaning into it to smell anything.  Nothing like other Yankee stuff in the past.  Production mistake?  Yankee's new cost-cutting philosophy?  Who knows.  Just $17 wasted.  We'll go back to generic candles bought at the supermarket.

Rief,"After reading all the rave reviews about Yankee Candles, and loving Vanilla scented candles, I was extremely disappointed after spending $30 on a large French Vanilla Yankee candle, receiving it, lighting it, and smelling.......NOTHING. ZIP. Even when I put my nose right up to it, lit or unlit, I smell NOTHING. I usually buy the Woodwick Vanilla candles, which are phenomenal. I happened to have one stashed away, so got it out, lit it up, and the wonderful vanilla aroma filled the room, and the whole house.....along with the delightful fireplace-like crackle of a Woodwick candle.

Now that it is half burned, I can barely smell the fragrance unless I lean over the top and really concentrate. It has been burning on an end table right next to me for the past two hours and nothing, no fragrance. So disappointing.

My candle arrived today, a couple of days early, which was nice. When I opened the box and inspected the contents, it was in pristine condition! The box and the protective enclosure inside was a little damaged, but that was it. So, I'm a happy camper with this purchase! I've purchased a couple of things through the warehouse and have never been disappointed, so I make it a habit to always check the warehouse before I make my purchase.

1403,Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Vanilla Cupcake,B000X457HO,Andre,"Great scent if you love birthday cake. Unfortunately everyone goes nose blind to scents after a while of being in the vicinity of a scent and after those few first glorious minutes of being in a room with this candle lit, you won't even notice the smell. That is ... until you walk out the room to so something (whether to go to the kitchen, bathroom, etc) and return to the room. Then the soothing smell of fresh birthday cake returns for a few minutes. Nose blindness is no fault of the candle. Just our stupid noses üò† Anyways I used this candle beyond what was recommended and had no issues. Do so at your own risk but I did use the candle until all the wax was nearly completely burned out. I've lit, put out, and relit this candle multiple times with no issue. So long as the bottom of the glass isn't getting hot there shouldn't be a risk of the candle and glass exploding. But then again, what do I know? Do so at your own risk but I just could not allow myself to stop using this candle once the wax reached below half. It smelled too good to waste. Also this candle is very aesthetically pleasing in a room. It blends in and the fire burning inside the glass jar just looks elegant.

Yankee's salted caramel scent is probably my favorite one so far. It is extremely sweet-smelling as you would expect, but it is not sickeningly sweet like I was worried it would be. It almost reminds me of bread baking or fresh cookies. It is a very warm and soothing smell that I would not necessarily describe as subtle because it will definitely fill up a room, but it is not overpowering and becomes part of the scenery. I got the Bahama Breeze scent along with this, and while I like that one, the scent is not nearly as strong as this one and is much less noticeable. I would be cautious of giving this as a gift to someone because I could see some thinking it is overly sweet. I don't think it is, but I like sweet scents so I may have a higher tolerance than some people. On the same token, I definitely recommend trying this for yourself, it's definitely a treat and will make you feel cozy the whole time it's burning.",5.0,2020-08-13,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

For some reason though this particular candle doesn't smell at all when it burns. You can smell it faintly when it's not burning, but I let it burn for over 2 hours and smelled nothing. I even asked my daughter and husband and even when you stand over top it, while burning....nothing. I've had many Yankee candles and even the mildly scented candles give off much more scent than this one. I'm thinking the candle is maybe just old, hence the price.

These candles are not cheap and should not arrive in such a shape as they did. I would like them to either be replaced or refund me my money.

1775,"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Midsummer's Night,Black",B000ORX6WI,J. W.,Yankee candles rarely disappoint in terms of their longevity and quality. I love this particular scent - it has a darker profile than many of Yankee‚Äôs other fragrance options. Unfortunately my partner commented ‚Äúthat smells like Axe‚Äù and I‚Äôm not sure I can argue with him. It is exponentially more subtle and the light notes are much less acrid than the body spray.,5.0,2021-12-10,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

You can smell them if you hold your nose up to the candle, but the scent just doesn‚Äôt dissipate much once lit. I‚Äôm incredibly disappointed and most likely will be submitting a return on BOTH candles. And this is definitely not the first time this has happened.

I thought Yankee were once the best? Apparently greed must have killed them like it does so many businesses these days. You get people running the biz that want to start using cheaper quality materials to make more profit, and they raise prices to ridiculous levels because people love their products. Only they don‚Äôt realize people aren‚Äôt as stupid as they hoped. The people begin to realize that they just aren‚Äôt as good as they once were and they are WAY out of the ballpark now for the Quality to Cost ratio. So people try another brand and go wow, that‚Äôs a great candle! And they never go back. They then talk to their friends about it and the friends ‚Äúwake up‚Äù and go ‚Äúyour right, their candles just aren‚Äôt that great anymore. Their prices have gotten ridiculous anyway.‚Äù It is now that they switch too over to that other brand that really knows how to make a great smelling candle, that stays smelling great, until the last bit of life leaves the flame on the wicks. I know for a fact that this happens as stated above. It is from direct experiences on my part, multiple times as well. I even started polling our friends and the majority of them actually verified the same sentiment. That Yankee Candles, which used to be everyone‚Äôs favorite, have gone downhill so badly and have gotten so crazy expensive, that it just does not make sense to keep wasting the amount of time I have to work to pay for them. I work hard. I want quality for my money and time. I‚Äôm not going to spend an hour working to throw away on garbage. Companies don‚Äôt respect the people who work to pay their salaries. The only thing they care about is my money and not the time I slaved at work just to purchase their crappy product. What happened to the days when ‚Äúcustomers come FIRST‚Äù? They‚Äôre gone and now it‚Äôs only about taking your money/time and passing it on to the fat executive that‚Äôs destroying their brand, just to make themselves and their greedy shareholders fatter and richer off the backs of those who do the REAL work in this world.... just for the privilege of buying their overpriced trinkets.",1.0,2020-11-25,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

I had bought her a Lemon Verbena candle (different brand) for Christmas, which smelled really nice.  But then we noticed the terrible black soot it left on her home office walls and ceiling...so much for buying another.  She's had dozens of Yankee candles over the years with no issues, and this one was ""Amazon's Choice"" so I went for it.  Simply put, this jar missed the fragrance nozzle on the assembly line.  We're talking basically no lemon, unless you concentrate it in a very small location.  And even then you have to practically singe your eyebrows off leaning into it to smell anything.

No I didn't return it, I don't believe in just returning things because you're unhappy with a smell, but I am disappointed with Yankee Candle for that.

2634,"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose",B078VJPW4Z,Rebo Quintana,"I have bought and used several of these candles in different fragrances, including: Lilac blossoms, Midnight Jasmine, Midsummer‚Äôs Night, Pink Sands, and Silver Birch. I have four dogs and one enormous great room, which includes the kitchen, dining area, entry way, living area, and the dogs‚Äô niche where their beds are. So I am always battling the smell to keep the house smelling nice. Overall, I would give this brand of candles 5 stars. Four out of the five fragrances I‚Äôve tried were pleasant smelling, had a strong odor that would fill the large room, and a long life. They were packaged very well (inside their own box) and burn evenly. Here are my ratings for the scents: Lilac: Five stars. Very strong smell. Sweet and flowery. I love lilac but it was a bit much for my taste for the main part of the house. Jasmine: Five Stars (more if I could!). Wonderful scent. Flowery but not over powering. Mellow. Lots of compliments on this one and asking where I got it, etc. Can be hard to find, too. Recommended. Midsummer‚Äôs Night. Five Stars. Pleasant, ‚Äúsoapy‚Äù smell. Reminds me of what the bathroom smells like after a shower. I loved this scent, but it is nicer for a bathroom than a main room IMO. Recommended. Pink Sands. Two Stars. Very ‚Äúpink‚Äù smelling. Reminded me of bubblegum. Scent was very weak. Could barely smell it at all. Wish I had returned it. Not recommended. Silver Birch. Five Stars. Very ‚Äúwoodsy.‚Äù Makes me think of fall/winter. Very pleasant smell for a main room. Recommended. I definitely recommend these candles overall, especially the four scenes above. The Pink Sands candle was such a dud I had to take off a star, but really these are good candles and worth the price.",4.0,2020-09-29,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

The smell is not terribly strong but also not necessarily weak, I imagine this would be a good choice for someone who likes fruity smells that aren't too overpowering. I gave this candle four stars instead of five because I was expecting a different (and admittedly stronger) smell but otherwise It is really a great candle. Just remember to always trim the wick before using it again because the wick starts to form black bulbs that fall off if you have the candle on after a while and you don't want these falling into the wax.",4.0,2021-02-20,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

I am willing to admit its possible I could have some allergy I never knew about from something they used in the candle making process. However. My very expensive coway air purifier that detects noxious smells and turns up accordingly has never been affected by any candles, even when i tried putting them literally a foot away it only turns up when I light or put them out. But this candle made it go off every time. Even then I wouldnt give them such a low star rating. Just thought it worth mentioning because people might not realize the candle is making them feel nauseous if that is the case. The reason I am writint this is because the candle was listed at beinf 35+ hours. And while I dont time it. I did not that my 10 hour candle lasted a lot longer than this thing did. Keep in mind these are mostly oppinions. Not actual facts if you want to be technical. The candle itself smelled very nice I thought. But for the price they charge, and given my experience?

Fresh Cut Roses is hands down my most favourite yankee candle scent ever! I normally buy the large jars but since the COVID stuff is going on, I couldn't afford the large jar. Next time, I will wait and spring for the large jar because this small tumbler does not do the scent justice. Even though we only place it in an average sized bathroom. The large jar that is placed in my bathroom will throw the scent in the bathroom and spew out into our entire master bedroom sized room very well and very strong! But this small tumbler barely fills just our bathroom. I assumed it would still saturate the bathroom but it did not. It was very weak. Maybe this yankee candle scent only works well in a larger jar than smaller jar. It did arrive with the wick not centered. It was a pain in the ass. We had to push the un-melted wax side down after each burn to even it out. But it still burned uneven and made more of a mess than tranquility. We contacted yankee candle directly and they did respond fast and did reimburse us, which was nice and surprising since some companies just say oh well too bad. That was the best part of this small tumbler experience. If you like yankee candle or have a favourite yankee candle scent. Get the largest jar for the best scent throw.

Watched a couple of YouTubes; was impressed. I was juusst about to buy another brand which was going to cost me $15 for only 6 ounces (should have stuck with that choice). However, I found some Yankee Candles at a good price. Received my ""Pink Sands"" candle fast! (happy/excited) But what a BIG disappointment! Absolutely ""No scent"" from my candle? And No, I don't have Covid (lol) Usually you can smell at least a slight scent during the unboxing stage. Even when removing the lid, still no scent? That should have been a hint. However, I thought ""maybe"" I needed to burn it to smell it. Still nothing? Placed it in a small bathroom with the door closed for about 15 min, still no scent? Tested on two other people ~ same result. Is it possible I got a ""DUD""? Maybe it is old?  I don't need an expensive emergency ""power outage"" candle. What a waste of money! Unsatisfied Customer here for sure! Even though it said it was new on the listing, It ""seems"" like it was maybe a return? And I'm sure if it was, it was due to the same problem. Unfortunately, you can only return the candle in new or unused condition. All the favorite Yankee Candle scents that YouTubers put in their top/favorite lists like, ""Pomegranate Cider"" or ""Pumpkin Wreath"" are recently listed for double compared to what I paid.

I recently ran out of my B&BW 20oz pumpkin candle which I loved, but I thought I'd try a smaller brand for a change. I was very disappointed for the following reasons: - the candle lacks any scent other than a faint smoke. I used it in a small 8x10 room with no external windows opened and I was unable to smell any difference at all, even from 2 feet away - the candle does not burn effectively and went out on me multiple times. I followed the lighting instructions to the T meaning cutting the wick to the correct length, cleaning out any debris, and always burning within the reccomended time limit. I still had it go out multiple times - this candle has severe tunneling issues. I think the wick might be too small for the diameter of the jar, because my candle melted out the inside only and left thick wax walls around the edges. Again, this was all while following the correct use instructions - the candle is tiny for its price. I realize it is listed as 8oz so I was expecting it to be small, but in light of the other problems listed above this seems an unacceptable price to size ratio. You can easily get 18 or 20 oz candles on this site that are better. Overall, I am disappointed and would not recommend this product to anyone. You're probably better off burning a generic unscented wax candle as it will give you the same effect and probably won't go out as much.",1.0,2021-01-25,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,negative

3255,"Yankee Candle Large 2-Wick Tumbler Candle, Spiced Pumpkin",B004USM1A0,Kyle H,"During pretty much any time of year I'm burning candles. I've burned cheaper ones like ""American home"" or ""village candle"" and I've burned nicer one's like ""yankee"" or ""kringle"". The cheaper candles are always faster burning and less fragrant. It's worth it to get a decent candle. Unless you REALLY want a specific (usually seasonal) scent, don't pay more than around 18$ for one of these. I've seen a bunch on here for like 25$+ and at that cost you're better off ordering kringle or some ""artisan"" brand. For 18ish bucks this candle is fantastic. This specific scent has lasted longer than some others, in that everyday I light it I can still smell it despite burning it for a week. Your nose and sense of smell is logarithmic (like your other senses) and after you have been exposed to the same smell for long enough, your brain stops recognizing it as unique and potent to your environment. It helps to buy several scents and rotate between them.",5.0,2020-10-19,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

At first I thought it was just air bubbles, but after getting a magnifying glass out and looking at it, it is definitely mold. I called customer service and they said I may have to return it for my refund. Which means I have to take it across town to the UPS store to return it.

I've gotten in the habit of doing this when I'm looking for a Yankee Candle. I found a Spiced Pumpkin large jar candle just a couple of days ago that was reduced to $13.39. So I decided to give it a shot. All of my past experiences have been good and this one was no exception! It arrived 1 full day early & it was very carefully packed. Upon opening, the jar was in excellent condition. Everything about the candle is authentic Yankee quality. However, when I removed the glass lid I saw that the wick was slightly singed, yet none of the wax surrounding it had been melted. Sort of like it had been lit and immediately blown out. It wasn't intended to be a gift; but if it was it wasn't giftable, so I rated it only 1 star for that category. I lit my candle and in a few seconds, no one was the wiser, lol...

Since its not a gift I went ahead and lit the wick. It is a faint scent, smells good, but hardly able to smell it unless I'm right up on the candle.

Fast forward a couple of weeks. Once the candle had burned down about an inch, all of the scent disappeared. I am so disappointed. I have practically a whole candle that has no aroma.

3267,"Yankee Candle Large 2-Wick Tumbler Candle, Spiced Pumpkin",B004USM1A0,Joe E.,"I have purchased many different brands of candles over the years trying to find a company that competes in its fragrances with Yankee candles. I finally decided several years ago that I would only buy Yankee candles and stop wasting my money on the other brands, since I am always disappointed with them. I was thrilled when I found my favorite Cranberry Chutney jar candle available on Amazon a couple of weeks before Christmas. However, as I have burned it over the past several days, I have been extremely disappointed. My house used to be filled with the delicious aroma from this candle, but this time, I can barely smell it. I have heard the excuse that people are complaining about Yankee candles' scents this year due to a loss of smell from Covid-19. That is not the case with me, because I have not contracted covid, and my sense of smell is just fine. If other people are complaining, I have a feeling the Yankee Candle Company has changed something in the way it adds the different fragrances to their candles, so now, they are less potent than they always have been. I want a candle that can fill my house with a delicious scent, not one that I have to keep trying to smell! If you are expecting the Yankee Candle of old when you purchase this one, you will be disappointed.

I did the return on Amazon myself & they told me not to return it that they would replace it. So my replacement comes & the top of the candle is uneven because it melted some. See photos for both. Now if your a candle burner then you know burning  a candle with an uneven top is going to continue to burn unevenly & can even get to the point where your not even done with the candle & you no longer can burn it because the wicks get buried. So I returned the second one & just gave up! I ordered it in Nov/Dec. & it‚Äôs not hot where I live in those months! Good luck & hope your experience goes better then mine.",4.0,2022-01-01,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive
3561,"Yankee Candle Large Jar, Christmas Cookie",B000C2TB6U,L Murphy,"I seem to be getting good longevity (burn-hours) for this candle and I enjoy the ""sugar cookie baking"" smell. It has decent candle ""throw"" but I think it could be better? It has a single wick and the top of the jar is slightly tapered, so this may hinder that, I don't know. It doesn't smoke if you start with a slightly trimmed wick before lighting it, but I wouldn't call it smokeless. That would make it ideal. I got a great price after the holidays so I can't complain.

I‚Äôve been buying a lot of my candles from small businesses, which I‚Äôm enjoying, but it was nice to get a Yankee Candle, because those were all my mom would burn when I was younger, so like I said, it was very nostalgic.

This purchase was delivered a day early and is a REAL Yankee Candle, not fake (believe me, I would know immediately if they were). People have asked me why I always buy the Yankee Candle brand? Because they're more expensive than others. I explain to them that I have bought other ""knockoffs"" to save money before, only to end up getting exactly what I paid for...wasted wax without any scent at the last 1/3 to 1/4 of the jar üòí, so they didn't save me anything. I don't work for the company, but I am a stickler for being well informed, so I know why the Yankee Candles cost more than their competitors... See, other companies only use their scented wax at the top 3/4 or 1/2 of their candle products, the bottom is just colored wax with a hint of scent. This way, they are able to trick the average customer into buying them. Don't get me wrong, at first, they all have great ""throw,"" however, as they burn down, their scent becomes much weaker. Some brands don't even use wicks long enough for their candles, causing them to fizzle out long before they should. Yankee Candle Company uses fully scented wax throughout the entire candle. They also have a high concentration of scented oils, to insure a strong throw of scent, from the first time you light it until it burns all the way down. *** P. S. Make sure you buy the REAL THING, not a cheap knockoff. I noticed that the complaints here are all about the ""Cinnamon Sparkle"" scent. Even though they're listed under the ""Home Sweet Home"" one. I ordered 2 of the ""Home Sweet Home"" scent here, and they're real Yankee Candle brand. If you get a fake one, like some of the other customers, report it to Amazon immediately! Amazon is just a distributor. They'll accept a return, even if your candle is burned to the wick, refund your money, then investigate to persecute the dirty posers!***",5.0,2021-07-02,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

The last one I had was bought about 5ish years ago and cycled seasonly with other Yankee Candles. It definitely always had a cinnamon smell but not like this. This one is almost satirical! This Home Sweet Home candle has such an exaggerated cinnamon smell, it burns the throat to smell it! You'll notice I made a point to let it be known I haven't bought a HSH Yankee candle in about 5 years. I did that incase Yankee has changed the formula to increase the Cinnamon. Or maybe it was a mistake buying on Amazon? Maybe it's a second? Or maybe I am just getting old and my olfactory glands are 'going' first? The only problem with the latter is the previous HSH candle I had was at it's wicks end and I was able to compare. So if it's my olfactory senses, they went haywire overnight. Yankee offers candles with Cinnamon in the name to let it be known cinnamon is what you're going to get. Wow, if they are more 'cinnamony' than this, it would double as a tear gas agent. Just imagine putting a Yankee cinnamon candle on a warmer during the holidays. One could clear out any family or friend visitors from sheer discomfort alone! This HSH is more than half way there. One could use this to politely clear any guests out of the home. It's just too much!",2.0,2021-12-19,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

I had bought her a Lemon Verbena candle (different brand) for Christmas, which smelled really nice.  But then we noticed the terrible black soot it left on her home office walls and ceiling...so much for buying another.  She's had dozens of Yankee candles over the years with no issues, and this one was ""Amazon's Choice"" so I went for it.  Simply put, this jar missed the fragrance nozzle on the assembly line.  We're talking basically no lemon, unless you concentrate it in a very small location.  And even then you have to practically singe your eyebrows off leaning into it to smell anything.  Nothing like other Yankee stuff in the past.  Production mistake?  Yankee's new cost-cutting philosophy?  Who knows.  Just $17 wasted.  We'll go back to generic candles bought at the supermarket.

It's the fresh pineapple aroma, though, that makes my whole bathroom so pleasant.",5.0,2021-08-30,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

4511,Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Mango Peach Salsa,B001PAPPKY,J. E. Doyle Jr.,"The candle burned better than some more recent Yankee Candles burning cleanly and leaving no wax residue on the sides. I did trim the wick at each Re-lighting however, as is good practice for a clean burning candle. The scent was disappointing providing relatively little lemon smell beyond the immediate location where it was burned, the kitchen, unlike some Yankee Candles I have purchased in the past. The longevity of this candle was good, lasting as long as was anticipated. This would make an ok gift, but better to buy one that you know is going to smell great as well as give a good lasting performance.",4.0,2021-04-27,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

The scent is only slightly apparent when you smell right above the candle. There are candles that are too strong, some that are just right, and this one that is a waste of money if you are buying for the scent. In most respects it performs like an unscented candle.

After burning in for three to five hours I can tell its more of a perfume type of smell over a natural citrus. It doesn't have a very good throw either as you need to be right up on it.

The large jar is an absolute great deal on sale! I highly suggest burning a minimum of 2-3 hours each time to avoid uneven wax around the outer circumference of the jar. Cheery bright yellow color.

4804,Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Pink Sands,B004G9C0SQ,Rebo Quintana,"I have bought and used several of these candles in different fragrances, including: Lilac blossoms, Midnight Jasmine, Midsummer‚Äôs Night, Pink Sands, and Silver Birch. I have four dogs and one enormous great room, which includes the kitchen, dining area, entry way, living area, and the dogs‚Äô niche where their beds are. So I am always battling the smell to keep the house smelling nice. Overall, I would give this brand of candles 5 stars. Four out of the five fragrances I‚Äôve tried were pleasant smelling, had a strong odor that would fill the large room, and a long life. They were packaged very well (inside their own box) and burn evenly. Here are my ratings for the scents: Lilac: Five stars. Very strong smell. Sweet and flowery. I love lilac but it was a bit much for my taste for the main part of the house. Jasmine: Five Stars (more if I could!). Wonderful scent. Flowery but not over powering. Mellow. Lots of compliments on this one and asking where I got it, etc. Can be hard to find, too. Recommended. Midsummer‚Äôs Night. Five Stars. Pleasant, ‚Äúsoapy‚Äù smell. Reminds me of what the bathroom smells like after a shower. I loved this scent, but it is nicer for a bathroom than a main room IMO. Recommended. Pink Sands. Two Stars. Very ‚Äúpink‚Äù smelling. Reminded me of bubblegum. Scent was very weak. Could barely smell it at all. Wish I had returned it. Not recommended. Silver Birch. Five Stars. Very ‚Äúwoodsy.‚Äù Makes me think of fall/winter. Very pleasant smell for a main room. Recommended. I definitely recommend these candles overall, especially the four scenes above. The Pink Sands candle was such a dud I had to take off a star, but really these are good candles and worth the price.",4.0,2020-09-29,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

I gave this candle four stars instead of five because I was expecting a different (and admittedly stronger) smell but otherwise It is really a great candle.

This is the only one that ever made me feel ill if I left it on for more than hour in a room that is about 11 by 12 feet. I am willing to admit its possible I could have some allergy I never knew about from something they used in the candle making process. However. My very expensive coway air purifier that detects noxious smells and turns up accordingly has never been affected by any candles, even when i tried putting them literally a foot away it only turns up when I light or put them out. But this candle made it go off every time. Even then I wouldnt give them such a low star rating. Just thought it worth mentioning because people might not realize the candle is making them feel nauseous if that is the case. The reason I am writint this is because the candle was listed at beinf 35+ hours. And while I dont time it. I did not that my 10 hour candle lasted a lot longer than this thing did. Keep in mind these are mostly oppinions. Not actual facts if you want to be technical. The candle itself smelled very nice I thought. But for the price they charge, and given my experience?

Fresh Cut Roses is hands down my most favourite yankee candle scent ever! I normally buy the large jars but since the COVID stuff is going on, I couldn't afford the large jar. Next time, I will wait and spring for the large jar because this small tumbler does not do the scent justice. Even though we only place it in an average sized bathroom. The large jar that is placed in my bathroom will throw the scent in the bathroom and spew out into our entire master bedroom sized room very well and very strong! But this small tumbler barely fills just our bathroom. I assumed it would still saturate the bathroom but it did not. It was very weak. Maybe this yankee candle scent only works well in a larger jar than smaller jar. It did arrive with the wick not centered. It was a pain in the ass. We had to push the un-melted wax side down after each burn to even it out. But it still burned uneven and made more of a mess than tranquility. We contacted yankee candle directly and they did respond fast and did reimburse us, which was nice and surprising since some companies just say oh well too bad. That was the best part of this small tumbler experience. If you like yankee candle or have a favourite yankee candle scent. Get the largest jar for the best scent throw.

I was juusst about to buy another brand which was going to cost me $15 for only 6 ounces (should have stuck with that choice). However, I found some Yankee Candles at a good price. Received my ""Pink Sands"" candle fast! (happy/excited) But what a BIG disappointment! Absolutely ""No scent"" from my candle? And No, I don't have Covid (lol) Usually you can smell at least a slight scent during the unboxing stage. Even when removing the lid, still no scent? That should have been a hint. However, I thought ""maybe"" I needed to burn it to smell it. Still nothing? Placed it in a small bathroom with the door closed for about 15 min, still no scent? Tested on two other people ~ same result. Is it possible I got a ""DUD""? Maybe it is old?  I don't need an expensive emergency ""power outage"" candle. What a waste of money! Unsatisfied Customer here for sure! Even though it said it was new on the listing, It ""seems"" like it was maybe a return? And I'm sure if it was, it was due to the same problem. Unfortunately, you can only return the candle in new or unused condition. All the favorite Yankee Candle scents that YouTubers put in their top/favorite lists like, ""Pomegranate Cider"" or ""Pumpkin Wreath"" are recently listed for double compared to what I paid. My candle ""Pink Sands"" was one of the lowest priced Yankee Candles I came across. Now I know why....I gave a rating of at least two stars. 1 for fast shipping and 1 for no broken glass.",2.0,2021-03-21,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,negative

This used to be my favorite, but the quality & longevity isn‚Äôt worth the price anymore. The scent is great- if you have your nose glued to the jar. Otherwise, I didn‚Äôt find it emitted much of anything (even in a tiny, studio apartment). I only had it burning for 2-3 hours on occasion, but it didn‚Äôt last more than a month. And, the wick wasn‚Äôt strong enough to keep a decent flame... started to stifle with pooling wax that also dissipated so quickly the entire thing didn‚Äôt last. I would feel bad giving this as a gift. As nice as it seems- it isn‚Äôt worth it and kind of a waste of money. Their candles used to be WAY better in scent & longevity.

The Yankee Candle was sent in a small box just large enough to hold it tightly,  The candle was melted, and had poured into the cap, leaked out into the box.....what a mess, and a waste of $25.  I will try to melt it and retrieve the wick, because I don't have a printer for the postage return, and I'm not going out to mail it during this COVID thing.

I didn't realize I checked the order today and found that I had 30 days to get a refund or replacement. Amazon customer service told me I could send it back but I would be charged a restocking fee, couldn't tell me how much the fee would be so after 34 minutes on the phone I called it quits. Good luck restocking that one if I would have sent it in. I'm a bit disappointed with Amazon as I've been a good customer for a number of years and figured they would do more.

It lasts about half an hour before the flame has nearly burned out.

I bought two of these large candles: Balsam and Cedar and Red Apple Wreath. (Wish I'd gotten Christmas Cookie.) To me, the Balsam and Cedar is the stronger smelling, but it smells a little more like soap than like a forest or a Christmas tree! The Red Apple Wreath has a lovely scent, but it would have been nice if the scent were a little stronger. The candles do last quite a long time, and thankfully, they burn clean. No nasty dark marks on ceilings or walls. That is a very important point to me. I like the containers, but these candles are so large that you really need a barbecue lighter to light them once they burn down low. Overall, very nice candles that would have been perfect five stars had the scent been up to par, but it just wasn't. This is especially true of my favorite of the two, the Red Apple Wreath.

I went on Amazon and read the reviews. I noticed most people said the candle had a very faint smell and the scent wasn't as strong as it used to be. I was hoping the company had read the reviews and it had improved the scent. Unfortunately, this is not the case. My candle arrived yesterday. I had high hopes for this candle. This was my first time purchasing a Yankee Candle and I was looking forward to enjoying this scent in my home. I was sadly mistaken. This candle do not have a scent. I literally have to lean over the candle and even then I can barely smell anything. The scent fades so quickly that even when the candle is burning, you still can not hardly smell it. I paid $18.00 for this candle which more than I have ever paid for a candle before. I get stronger scented candles from the Dollar Tree that smell better than this one. I will never purchase this brand again. I don't recommend anyone to purchase this candle if you are looking for a decent smelling candle.",1.0,2021-10-03,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

I would open the candle lid and even without lighting it, you can already smell it in the room, although quite lightly, and much more intensely if you light it. Since I heard good things about Yankee candles, thought I'd give this one a shot. Very nice smell, almost like a masculine cologne. I lit it for 15 minutes and can barely smell it, I have to have it right near my hand as I'm typing on my laptop to even smell it as much as I'd like to. The smell is fantastic, once again, but it does not spread throughout the room very much, it either has to be near my hand or I have to literally pick it up to smell it well. With all of my other candles, like the one I mentioned above, it takes all of 5 minutes and I can smell it throughout my entire APARTMENT.

I tried another, then a third.  It seemed that perhaps because there  was no tight closure with the looser "" flat lid""  , the scent had ""worn off "" or ""worn away."" ""escaped""  When I mentioned this to my girlfriends at lunch, they had had the same experience with this kind of flat lid vs. the tight -fitting  glass, chunky lid.  So... If you want a lovely candle and are not looking for a scent,  this candle _style is for you. It burns slowly, ( all Yankee Candle do !!)  ,so you get more for your $.than a regular candle.  I just always buy Yankee Candles for their scent.  The scent is ALWAYS consistent, as is the quality of the product.  Yankee Candles don't get smokey as some candles often do. I'd also like to add that Yankee Candles do an excellent job wrapping and shipping their candles.  All the candles are well-wrapped and arrive amazingly fast. Bottom line ?  I LOVE  Yankee Candles .

They also said that there are factors that that could impact the scent such as room size, other odours present, air flow and temperature (which sounds like hog wash to me).

But my problem is the fact that the candle is crappy, to say the least. It's like the wicks are burning faster then the wax, so the wicks get super small and the melted wax ends up covering the wicks...such a waste of a good candle. That's the 2 wick candle as well, o switched over to that style because the single wicks were burning terribly, I got a candle that burnt almost straight down, it was a pain and I ended up throwing it away, wasting probably a ‚Öì of the candle. I've always had good luck in the past, but my last 2 purchases have really left a bad taste in my mouth and I'm not sure I wanna spend my hard earned money on wastful products.

They ruin it, and perhaps cut back or use a cheaper essential oil. Whatever they're doing, it's a shame. This decline has gone on for years, and I have had it! Why must corporation buy great companies and ruin what was once the best candle on the market?  From now on, I will purchase candles elsewhere, from another company..Perhaps the original sons new Candle company will return to create the original great scented candles. Maybe corporations will learn, they can only short change decades long customers for so long before they ruin their investment and lose more customers for good. Shame on corporate greed ruining a once great candle company.

However, due to the Covid Pandemic I decided to order on line via Amazon. I enjoy a woodsy candle scent during the winter months and my favorite was Cozy Cabin, that is discontinued. I ordered Velvet Woods for the holidays and it was absolutely satisfying and put me in a relaxing mood. This soy based candle melted evenly and the double wicks didn't fray. I bought Mountain Lodge at the same time, to try it too because it was a reasonable price. Sadly, the scent is hardly noticeable and the wick frays terribly. It may be due the difference in the soy verses just wax. I don't know if I just got a badly mixed candle but I'm very disappointed in this Mountain Lodge scent. Plus, the poor quality wick frays as it burns, shining an unequal glow. I may purchase the Mountain Lodge candle scent from a different seller just to compare the two.

The candle it self smells absolutely great! A wonderful clean woodsy scent that doesn't have a over powering smell of pine like a lot of ""outdoorsy"" scented candles tend to have. It makes me reminisce about my stay in the mountains this past summer.  It also has a good throw but isn't super strong. I would definitely buy the candle again, maybe just not from Amazon?

As you can see from my photos the whole candle melted before it even got to me, so I can't actually find the wick to light the candle anyway. Maybe it's my fault for ordering a candle in the summer time, but I guess the combination of heat from transit and the candle actually being packaged on its side means it's very possible someone else might receive a candle like mine (messy and unusable). I might try to leave it out in my car for a day to see if I can get it melted back into the jar, but there's no telling if I'll be able to find the wick even if that works.

6437,Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Fresh Cut Roses,B00069ZDJS,Rebo Quintana,"I have bought and used several of these candles in different fragrances, including: Lilac blossoms, Midnight Jasmine, Midsummer‚Äôs Night, Pink Sands, and Silver Birch. I have four dogs and one enormous great room, which includes the kitchen, dining area, entry way, living area, and the dogs‚Äô niche where their beds are. So I am always battling the smell to keep the house smelling nice. Overall, I would give this brand of candles 5 stars. Four out of the five fragrances I‚Äôve tried were pleasant smelling, had a strong odor that would fill the large room, and a long life. They were packaged very well (inside their own box) and burn evenly. Here are my ratings for the scents: Lilac: Five stars. Very strong smell. Sweet and flowery. I love lilac but it was a bit much for my taste for the main part of the house. Jasmine: Five Stars (more if I could!). Wonderful scent. Flowery but not over powering. Mellow. Lots of compliments on this one and asking where I got it, etc. Can be hard to find, too. Recommended. Midsummer‚Äôs Night. Five Stars. Pleasant, ‚Äúsoapy‚Äù smell. Reminds me of what the bathroom smells like after a shower. I loved this scent, but it is nicer for a bathroom than a main room IMO. Recommended. Pink Sands. Two Stars. Very ‚Äúpink‚Äù smelling. Reminded me of bubblegum. Scent was very weak. Could barely smell it at all. Wish I had returned it. Not recommended. Silver Birch. Five Stars. Very ‚Äúwoodsy.‚Äù Makes me think of fall/winter. Very pleasant smell for a main room. Recommended. I definitely recommend these candles overall, especially the four scenes above. The Pink Sands candle was such a dud I had to take off a star, but really these are good candles and worth the price.",4.0,2020-09-29,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

The smell is not terribly strong but also not necessarily weak, I imagine this would be a good choice for someone who likes fruity smells that aren't too overpowering. I gave this candle four stars instead of five because I was expecting a different (and admittedly stronger) smell but otherwise It is really a great candle. Just remember to always trim the wick before using it again because the wick starts to form black bulbs that fall off if you have the candle on after a while and you don't want these falling into the wax.",4.0,2021-02-20,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

6449,Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Fresh Cut Roses,B00069ZDJS,Nekomancer,"I have been using candles for years. This is the only one that ever made me feel ill if I left it on for more than hour in a room that is about 11 by 12 feet. I am willing to admit its possible I could have some allergy I never knew about from something they used in the candle making process. However. My very expensive coway air purifier that detects noxious smells and turns up accordingly has never been affected by any candles, even when i tried putting them literally a foot away it only turns up when I light or put them out. But this candle made it go off every time. Even then I wouldnt give them such a low star rating. Just thought it worth mentioning because people might not realize the candle is making them feel nauseous if that is the case. The reason I am writint this is because the candle was listed at beinf 35+ hours. And while I dont time it. I did not that my 10 hour candle lasted a lot longer than this thing did. Keep in mind these are mostly oppinions. Not actual facts if you want to be technical. The candle itself smelled very nice I thought. But for the price they charge, and given my experience? I can say I personally will never even bother buying such an overhyped object that basically amounts to a some wax, an essential oil and a wick.

6451,Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Fresh Cut Roses,B00069ZDJS,AmazonAddict,"This is an honest non paid for non free item given review. Fresh Cut Roses is hands down my most favourite yankee candle scent ever! I normally buy the large jars but since the COVID stuff is going on, I couldn't afford the large jar. Next time, I will wait and spring for the large jar because this small tumbler does not do the scent justice. Even though we only place it in an average sized bathroom. The large jar that is placed in my bathroom will throw the scent in the bathroom and spew out into our entire master bedroom sized room very well and very strong! But this small tumbler barely fills just our bathroom. I assumed it would still saturate the bathroom but it did not. It was very weak. Maybe this yankee candle scent only works well in a larger jar than smaller jar. It did arrive with the wick not centered. It was a pain in the ass. We had to push the un-melted wax side down after each burn to even it out. But it still burned uneven and made more of a mess than tranquility. We contacted yankee candle directly and they did respond fast and did reimburse us, which was nice and surprising since some companies just say oh well too bad. That was the best part of this small tumbler experience. If you like yankee candle or have a favourite yankee candle scent. Get the largest jar for the best scent throw. This small tumbler just doesn't measure up to the large jar.",3.0,2020-04-23,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

I was juusst about to buy another brand which was going to cost me $15 for only 6 ounces (should have stuck with that choice). However, I found some Yankee Candles at a good price. Received my ""Pink Sands"" candle fast! (happy/excited) But what a BIG disappointment! Absolutely ""No scent"" from my candle? And No, I don't have Covid (lol) Usually you can smell at least a slight scent during the unboxing stage. Even when removing the lid, still no scent? That should have been a hint. However, I thought ""maybe"" I needed to burn it to smell it. Still nothing? Placed it in a small bathroom with the door closed for about 15 min, still no scent? Tested on two other people ~ same result. Is it possible I got a ""DUD""? Maybe it is old?  I don't need an expensive emergency ""power outage"" candle. What a waste of money! Unsatisfied Customer here for sure! Even though it said it was new on the listing, It ""seems"" like it was maybe a return? And I'm sure if it was, it was due to the same problem. Unfortunately, you can only return the candle in new or unused condition. All the favorite Yankee Candle scents that YouTubers put in their top/favorite lists like, ""Pomegranate Cider"" or ""Pumpkin Wreath"" are recently listed for double compared to what I paid. My candle ""Pink Sands"" was one of the lowest priced Yankee Candles I came across.

I could smell them all over my house when I burned one.  However, over the past couple of years they have changed their formula and you can barely smell anything.

Not worth the money and I will, sadly, not buy any of their candles again.",1.0,2020-06-08,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

It's so beachy, and is a little reminiscent of a nice-smelling suntan lotion from days of yore. Used to be that this scent was one of Yankee Candle's stronger ones. Now that most YC's have lost their strong scent (and some of them seem to have no scent at all), at least you can smell this one. But it is very light, so it's great for people like my sister who don't tolerate strongly scented candles. If I could buy the old version though, the more strongly scented one, I would! This one has the same scent, just not as strong. Also, I like that the two-wick tumbler is an option. Used to be it was only the one-wick large jar, the classic Yankee Candle. The two-wick tumbler has a more even burn, and you don't have to burn it for four full hours, as you do with the large one-wick jar, to maintain the integrity of the wax. And no worries about tunneling. So I buy the tumbler version. If I knew I wanted to be at home and burn it for four hours at a time, I'd buy the classic jar version. It lasts longer. PS - I did buy one the jar version of this candle recently, and the scent isn't any stronger than the tumbler version.

6972,Yankee Candle Iced Berry Lemonade Signature Large Tumbler Candle,B08TZS82PY,J.Adams,"I actually ordered a Yankee Candle Signature Large Tumbler Candle with two-wicks in the scent Black Tea and Lemon. Instead, I received a Yankee Candle Scentlight, which is fine. It's a much more expensive product and there's no risk of fire with this essential oil diffuser. The Yankee Candle Scentlight Essential Oil Diffuser Set comes with a diffuser that lights up and an essential oil cartridge. The diffuser can be plugged in or used with batteries. .There's a convenient timer on the diffuser that allows for 5 hours per day use and lasts up to 30 days. In my opinion, that's great cartridge life! This Scentlight Essential Oil Diffuser would make a terrific gift for anyone, but especially for a college student, someone just moving into their own place, or a thoughtful housewarming gift! Because the Yankee Candle Scentlight uses cartridges, you'll get indefinite use out of one diffuser! You also won't have the concerns you'd normally have with burning candles. I'm sending this Scentlight diffuser to college with our son this fall. He said he'd love to have it and I'm sure it'll make living in a dorm room more acceptable!

6973,Yankee Candle Iced Berry Lemonade Signature Large Tumbler Candle,B08TZS82PY,Susie Williams,"I didn't receive the product I ordered, but instead am reviewing this Scentlight, which is a flameless candle that's operated with a fan. Products like these have come a long way over the years and this is a good-looking diffuser that I don't mind keeping out (some of them are so ugly and/or cheesy and don't mix well with my decor). It also works really well! My diffuser came with a Clean Cotton fragrance refill, but when that's gone, I could purchase any other refills I wanted. Luckily, I do love Clean Cotton! I currently have this in my kitchen to test it out, but will probably move it to a bedroom since clean cotton isn't the best kitchen fragrance! However, it is very strong and despite the fact I have a large kitchen that opens up into a dining room and office, it's almost too much for me and I fear it will be way too much for a small bedroom. I do think it's better to have it too strong rather than not strong enough... It just means I usually have to turn it off long before the 5 hour timer is up. I haven't even turned it on in a few days and can still smell it when I walk by it. I love the little glow it gives off.  It automatically makes a space feel more special. Overall, this is a great product that works really well and will fit in nicely with most decor!",4.0,2021-08-09,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive
6974,Yankee Candle Iced Berry Lemonade Signature Large Tumbler Candle,B08TZS82PY,Amazon Customer,"As you can see from my photos, what I received was not the tumbler candle. I received a ""Scent Light"" fragrance warmer. It is a battery powered(4 AA batteries, not included) warmer that uses little scent pods(1 included). Even though it wasn't what I had ordered, I really like it. It's pretty when it's not on and even prettier when it is on. The scent pod smelled really strong and I was worried that it would be overpowering and give me a headache but in the warmer the scent is lighter. It has a good ""throw"" and will scent a rather large space but it's not a heavy or just ""too much."" I wish it had a plug in or USB option but being battery powered means you can put it just about anywhere and not worry about whether there's an outlet nearby. There is a timer feature that allows you to set it to be on for 5hrs and then shut off and then come on again automatically at the same time the following day.",4.0,2021-07-02,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive
6975,Yankee Candle Iced Berry Lemonade Signature Large Tumbler Candle,B08TZS82PY,August Chianese,"Instead of the Black tea and lemon candle, they sent me a Scent Light which is a kind of diffuser which Yankee sells refills for. Mine came with Clean Cotton. Actually very happy because this thing works wonders! Put it in the corner of the room and let it go and the whole room gets a nice bit of fragrance to it that isn't too much but remains noticeable enough. It has been running a few hours a day now for over a month and its still going, so I think that's a good sign. Plus the device itself is nice looking. Its like a silver cannister design with a wood-like bottom, plus it has a light inside that pokes through little transparent spots in the silver coating. Very contemporary looking, could match with just about any decor. If you do think about getting one, I highly recommend them.

I will say that the scentlight is an effective and attractive way to scent the home. It has a nice subtle pattern and doubles as a nightlight. It can be plugged in or powered by batteries and has a timer that will make it diffuse the oil for 5 hours at the same time each day so you don't have to turn it on manually. However, the ""cotton"" scent is very strong - so strong that I didn't even have to turn the diffuser on for the scent to fill the room.

It's really nice, but I will say I'm a little bummed I didn't get to see what the black tea fragrance smells like! I love black tea, so a candle in the fragrance would be so perfect for me. Instead I got a diffuser with a clean cotton type fragrance. It works great for the bathroom, providing a night light and fresh scent throughout the day.

ZIP. Even when I put my nose right up to it, lit or unlit, I smell NOTHING. I usually buy the Woodwick Vanilla candles, which are phenomenal. I happened to have one stashed away, so got it out, lit it up, and the wonderful vanilla aroma filled the room, and the whole house.....along with the delightful fireplace-like crackle of a Woodwick candle.

Now that it is half burned, I can barely smell the fragrance unless I lean over the top and really concentrate. It has been burning on an end table right next to me for the past two hours and nothing, no fragrance. So disappointing.

My candle arrived today, a couple of days early, which was nice. When I opened the box and inspected the contents, it was in pristine condition! The box and the protective enclosure inside was a little damaged, but that was it. So, I'm a happy camper with this purchase! I've purchased a couple of things through the warehouse and have never been disappointed, so I make it a habit to always check the warehouse before I make my purchase.

7212,Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Caf√© Al Fresco,B01NAAQLZ1,Andre,"Great scent if you love birthday cake. Unfortunately everyone goes nose blind to scents after a while of being in the vicinity of a scent and after those few first glorious minutes of being in a room with this candle lit, you won't even notice the smell. That is ... until you walk out the room to so something (whether to go to the kitchen, bathroom, etc) and return to the room. Then the soothing smell of fresh birthday cake returns for a few minutes. Nose blindness is no fault of the candle. Just our stupid noses üò† Anyways I used this candle beyond what was recommended and had no issues. Do so at your own risk but I did use the candle until all the wax was nearly completely burned out. I've lit, put out, and relit this candle multiple times with no issue. So long as the bottom of the glass isn't getting hot there shouldn't be a risk of the candle and glass exploding. But then again, what do I know? Do so at your own risk but I just could not allow myself to stop using this candle once the wax reached below half. It smelled too good to waste. Also this candle is very aesthetically pleasing in a room. It blends in and the fire burning inside the glass jar just looks elegant.

7234,Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Caf√© Al Fresco,B01NAAQLZ1,Matt Wallenstein,"I like to burn candles in my apartment because I find that freshening sprays don't always last as long as I would like, and incense is just too strong and invasive for me to want to use it consistently. Yankee's salted caramel scent is probably my favorite one so far. It is extremely sweet-smelling as you would expect, but it is not sickeningly sweet like I was worried it would be. It almost reminds me of bread baking or fresh cookies. It is a very warm and soothing smell that I would not necessarily describe as subtle because it will definitely fill up a room, but it is not overpowering and becomes part of the scenery. I got the Bahama Breeze scent along with this, and while I like that one, the scent is not nearly as strong as this one and is much less noticeable. I would be cautious of giving this as a gift to someone because I could see some thinking it is overly sweet. I don't think it is, but I like sweet scents so I may have a higher tolerance than some people. On the same token, I definitely recommend trying this for yourself, it's definitely a treat and will make you feel cozy the whole time it's burning.",5.0,2020-08-13,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

They are either knock offs or rejects!  GUARANTEED!  I did a test. I started two candles in my home and worked outside for three hours. I came back into house and could barely smell anything. Something is wrong with these candles. Amending two weeks afternoon burning. These candles suck and provide no scent. Total rip off.

There is nothing more frustrating than spending a good chunk of money on a candle that can't send out a fragrance (not even in the room that it's  placed in). The scent throw is very poor. The cold scent is also weak. My husband bought 5 Yankee Candles from Amazon.  Two Vanilla Cupcake, which is the worst of them. Two Spiced Pumpkin, which has a strong cold scent, but again little scent throw when lit. And the 5th candle, called Home Sweet Home, we haven't yet burned. Hopefully, results will be better. I guess Yankee Candle Co. has switched production materials since I last had their candle (it's been a long time).  I've been buying other candle brands & I love using wax melts.

The delivery reached me pretty safely and on time so I‚Äôm glad overall.  4/5 stars coz the throw was not as incredible as I had excepted it to be.

She's had dozens of Yankee candles over the years with no issues, and this one was ""Amazon's Choice"" so I went for it.  Simply put, this jar missed the fragrance nozzle on the assembly line.  We're talking basically no lemon, unless you concentrate it in a very small location.  And even then you have to practically singe your eyebrows off leaning into it to smell anything.  Nothing like other Yankee stuff in the past.  Production mistake?  Yankee's new cost-cutting philosophy?  Who knows.  Just $17 wasted.  We'll go back to generic candles bought at the supermarket.

I always burn my candles 1 hour per ‚Äú of the diameter of the jar, so the initial burn was 4 hours. No tunneling, quality 2 weeks. I don‚Äôt want to say the scent is ‚Äúoverpowering‚Äù as that word has a negative connotation. I light mine in my master bathroom, leave the door open so the bulk of the scent is in the bathroom and a lighter scent fills the connected bedroom, and I like it that way. Don‚Äôt regret, yet unsure if I‚Äôll buy again. Smell is so objective so you may adore this (or not) but I described it best I could.",4.0,2021-01-22,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

I had an older Yankee Candle with the same aroma and had put it in an even stronger smelling new cabinet, and it is still working.

I did trim the wick at each Re-lighting however, as is good practice for a clean burning candle. The scent was disappointing providing relatively little lemon smell beyond the immediate location where it was burned, the kitchen, unlike some Yankee Candles I have purchased in the past. The longevity of this candle was good, lasting as long as was anticipated.

8167,"Yankee Candle Elevation Collection with Platform Lid Passionflower Scented Candle, Large 2-Wick, 80 Hour Burn Time",B07P9S8VZR,JPH,"This is my first, and probably my last, Yankee Candle. Takes a while to get going and would probably have been more effective as a 3-wick rather than 2-wick candle.  Scent throw is very good, subtle but pervasive over a wide area and remains in the air for a while after the candle is extinguished/covered.  The scent is very floral, pleasant, but I don't pick up the advertised lime/jasmine tea. As one reviewer has noted, after the candle burns down a bit, it really does look like a brain.  There are channels throughout the candle, making it look like the amygdala.  Perhaps a cost-cutting measure, candle burns using less wax. This candle was a nice one-off, nothing about the candle that would compel me to purchase it again.",3.0,2021-10-29,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

First off, I got the tall tumbler with the 2 wicks. It was only $14 which was well worth it, in my opinion. These candles live up to the hype. The scent is wonderful and aromatic. Reminds me of fall which is exactly what I was trying to go for. These candles burn so evenly. I don't know if that's due to the brand and their formula in general or the double-wick, but I love it.

First off, I got the tall tumbler with the 2 wicks. It was only $14 which was well worth it, in my opinion. These candles live up to the hype. The scent is wonderful and aromatic. Reminds me of fall which is exactly what I was trying to go for. These candles burn so evenly. I don't know if that's due to the brand and their formula in general or the double-wick, but I love it. I've burned for hours already and it's only gone down maybe about half an inch.

8335,"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Autumn Wreath",B000TVJ6XW,Kyle H,"During pretty much any time of year I'm burning candles. I've burned cheaper ones like ""American home"" or ""village candle"" and I've burned nicer one's like ""yankee"" or ""kringle"". The cheaper candles are always faster burning and less fragrant. It's worth it to get a decent candle. Unless you REALLY want a specific (usually seasonal) scent, don't pay more than around 18$ for one of these. I've seen a bunch on here for like 25$+ and at that cost you're better off ordering kringle or some ""artisan"" brand. For 18ish bucks this candle is fantastic. This specific scent has lasted longer than some others, in that everyday I light it I can still smell it despite burning it for a week. Your nose and sense of smell is logarithmic (like your other senses) and after you have been exposed to the same smell for long enough, your brain stops recognizing it as unique and potent to your environment. It helps to buy several scents and rotate between them.",5.0,2020-10-19,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

I've gotten in the habit of doing this when I'm looking for a Yankee Candle. I found a Spiced Pumpkin large jar candle just a couple of days ago that was reduced to $13.39. So I decided to give it a shot. All of my past experiences have been good and this one was no exception! It arrived 1 full day early & it was very carefully packed. Upon opening, the jar was in excellent condition. Everything about the candle is authentic Yankee quality. However, when I removed the glass lid I saw that the wick was slightly singed, yet none of the wax surrounding it had been melted. Sort of like it had been lit and immediately blown out. It wasn't intended to be a gift; but if it was it wasn't giftable, so I rated it only 1 star for that category. I lit my candle and in a few seconds, no one was the wiser, lol...

I finally decided several years ago that I would only buy Yankee candles and stop wasting my money on the other brands, since I am always disappointed with them. I was thrilled when I found my favorite Cranberry Chutney jar candle available on Amazon a couple of weeks before Christmas. However, as I have burned it over the past several days, I have been extremely disappointed. My house used to be filled with the delicious aroma from this candle, but this time, I can barely smell it. I have heard the excuse that people are complaining about Yankee candles' scents this year due to a loss of smell from Covid-19. That is not the case with me, because I have not contracted covid, and my sense of smell is just fine. If other people are complaining, I have a feeling the Yankee Candle Company has changed something in the way it adds the different fragrances to their candles, so now, they are less potent than they always have been. I want a candle that can fill my house with a delicious scent, not one that I have to keep trying to smell!

I had bought her a Lemon Verbena candle (different brand) for Christmas, which smelled really nice.  But then we noticed the terrible black soot it left on her home office walls and ceiling...so much for buying another.  She's had dozens of Yankee candles over the years with no issues, and this one was ""Amazon's Choice"" so I went for it.  Simply put, this jar missed the fragrance nozzle on the assembly line.  We're talking basically no lemon, unless you concentrate it in a very small location.  And even then you have to practically singe your eyebrows off leaning into it to smell anything.  Nothing like other Yankee stuff in the past.  Production mistake?  Yankee's new cost-cutting philosophy?  Who knows.  Just $17 wasted.  We'll go back to generic candles bought at the supermarket.

I love the smell of peach and mango, so I was excited when I saw this candle. I remembered going to the Yankee Candle stores and being overwhelmed with how strong/powerful/real their scents were. The candles from them I used to get always smelled great and filled the room.  I expected the same.

I love the fresh scent of lemons and was looking forward to enjoying this Sicilian Lemon variety. After burning this candle for days now,  I can't detect any noticeable scent. Even up close,  I'm getting no aroma from this candle. That being said,  it does have a good slow burn and as always, comes in a jar that I enjoy for it's size and being able to cap it when extinguishing it.

The name of the candle, Strawberry Lemon Ice is a good description of the scent. If you don‚Äôt like fruity you won‚Äôt like this. I am in the ‚Äúburns fruity for certain occasions and for myself perhaps 2 times in 2 weeks. The scent comes out, nicely, within 10 minutes or less of lighting it. I always burn my candles 1 hour per ‚Äú of the diameter of the jar, so the initial burn was 4 hours. No tunneling, quality 2 weeks. I don‚Äôt want to say the scent is ‚Äúoverpowering‚Äù as that word has a negative connotation. I light mine in my master bathroom, leave the door open so the bulk of the scent is in the bathroom and a lighter scent fills the connected bedroom, and I like it that way.

I did trim the wick at each Re-lighting however, as is good practice for a clean burning candle. The scent was disappointing providing relatively little lemon smell beyond the immediate location where it was burned, the kitchen, unlike some Yankee Candles I have purchased in the past. The longevity of this candle was good, lasting as long as was anticipated.

After burning in for three to five hours I can tell its more of a perfume type of smell over a natural citrus. It doesn't have a very good throw either as you need to be right up on it. Great candle but I'll try a different option for Orange/Citrus. Update- After burning for approximately 15- 20 hours it has gotten better. Better throw and scent.

Very squeamish about fires starting. YANKEE gives you both--great scent and nice thick glass. Would definitely give as a gift to candle lovers like me.

I happened to have one stashed away, so got it out, lit it up, and the wonderful vanilla aroma filled the room, and the whole house.....along with the delightful fireplace-like crackle of a Woodwick candle.

The box and the protective enclosure inside was a little damaged, but that was it. So, I'm a happy camper with this purchase! I've purchased a couple of things through the warehouse and have never been disappointed, so I make it a habit to always check the warehouse before I make my purchase.

9704,Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle French Vanilla,B000W3T9GG,Andre,"Great scent if you love birthday cake. Unfortunately everyone goes nose blind to scents after a while of being in the vicinity of a scent and after those few first glorious minutes of being in a room with this candle lit, you won't even notice the smell. That is ... until you walk out the room to so something (whether to go to the kitchen, bathroom, etc) and return to the room. Then the soothing smell of fresh birthday cake returns for a few minutes. Nose blindness is no fault of the candle. Just our stupid noses üò† Anyways I used this candle beyond what was recommended and had no issues. Do so at your own risk but I did use the candle until all the wax was nearly completely burned out. I've lit, put out, and relit this candle multiple times with no issue. So long as the bottom of the glass isn't getting hot there shouldn't be a risk of the candle and glass exploding. But then again, what do I know? Do so at your own risk but I just could not allow myself to stop using this candle once the wax reached below half. It smelled too good to waste. Also this candle is very aesthetically pleasing in a room. It blends in and the fire burning inside the glass jar just looks elegant.

Only because they are expensive, but they are so worth it. They really last a long time and will permeate the room if you burn them long enough. I accidentally left a pumpkin one burning for two days in the back of our house. That room smelled lovely for weeks and weeks. If you get yours and the packaging has residue all over it, just wash the candle and lid off and it's fine. I don't know how it happened, but I don't mind.

Normally, the smell of most candles will envelope my room and my roommates will compliment the smell when they pass by, however, there is no smell wafting or emanating from my room with this candle. Also, since there is only one wick in this candle, it melted unevenly. It was kind of unsightly to look at.

9726,Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle French Vanilla,B000W3T9GG,Matt Wallenstein,"I like to burn candles in my apartment because I find that freshening sprays don't always last as long as I would like, and incense is just too strong and invasive for me to want to use it consistently. Yankee's salted caramel scent is probably my favorite one so far. It is extremely sweet-smelling as you would expect, but it is not sickeningly sweet like I was worried it would be. It almost reminds me of bread baking or fresh cookies. It is a very warm and soothing smell that I would not necessarily describe as subtle because it will definitely fill up a room, but it is not overpowering and becomes part of the scenery. I got the Bahama Breeze scent along with this, and while I like that one, the scent is not nearly as strong as this one and is much less noticeable. I would be cautious of giving this as a gift to someone because I could see some thinking it is overly sweet. I don't think it is, but I like sweet scents so I may have a higher tolerance than some people. On the same token, I definitely recommend trying this for yourself, it's definitely a treat and will make you feel cozy the whole time it's burning.",5.0,2020-08-13,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,positive

Two Spiced Pumpkin, which has a strong cold scent, but again little scent throw when lit. And the 5th candle, called Home Sweet Home, we haven't yet burned. Hopefully, results will be better. I guess Yankee Candle Co. has switched production materials since I last had their candle (it's been a long time).  I've been buying other candle brands & I love using wax melts.

Unless you open it up and stir the pellets with your finger and then smell your finger the scent is very faint. I like Yankee candle but I‚Äôll never buy this product again ever",2.0,2020-05-27,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yankee+candles&crid=WD6W3P07VAKL,negative

Then I received another damaged candle. This is a gift, so I'm trying again for a replacement, but I have a feeling that I will receive yet again another damaged candle.
