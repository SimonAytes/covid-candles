Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Home Sweet Home,B000WUFVR0,Just sayin'..,"I have had this scent for almost 20 years, give it take. The last one I had was bought about 5ish years ago and cycled seasonly with other Yankee Candles. It definitely always had a cinnamon smell but not like this. This one is almost satirical! This Home Sweet Home candle has such an exaggerated cinnamon smell, it burns the throat to smell it! You'll notice I made a point to let it be known I haven't bought a HSH Yankee candle in about 5 years. I did that incase Yankee has changed the formula to increase the Cinnamon. Or maybe it was a mistake buying on Amazon? Maybe it's a second? Or maybe I am just getting old and my olfactory glands are 'going' first? The only problem with the latter is the previous HSH candle I had was at it's wicks end and I was able to compare. So if it's my olfactory senses, they went haywire overnight. Yankee offers candles with Cinnamon in the name to let it be known cinnamon is what you're going to get. Wow, if they are more 'cinnamony' than this, it would double as a tear gas agent. Just imagine putting a Yankee cinnamon candle on a warmer during the holidays. One could clear out any family or friend visitors from sheer discomfort alone! This HSH is more than half way there. One could use this to politely clear any guests out of the home. It's just too much!",2.0,2021-12-19,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000WUFVR0/?pageNumber=2,positive
Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Home Sweet Home,B000WUFVR0,RSS,"The scent is good if you like a really spicey aroma. I am not too happy about it but I hope the person I give it to likes the scent. Because it smells so spicey, I would recommend using it in a kitchen, breakfast room or dining room. I bought this to give to someone for a housewarming gift because the name of the candle is Home Sweet Home. I was very happy with the way this candle was packaged. It was wrapped very well in a shell of fitted cardboard and then boxed. It was delivered quickly and was completely intact, which is great because the candle is in a glass jar. I think this candle was too expensive, but I think all Yankee Candles are too expensive. I wish Yankee Candle would make more candle scents for housewarming gifts and name them accordingly.",3.0,2021-10-14,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000WUFVR0/?pageNumber=3,positive
Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Home Sweet Home,B000WUFVR0,Lori K,"The two candles I bought are sitting in the exact spot I always put the candles I buy directly from Yankee. Even so, they burned down the middle like cheap candles.  I had to scrap the wax off the sides to fill in the cavern. That helped somewhat build the sides, but the wick is spent.  Huge waste of money. They smell great and look great until you start using them. Reviews on the Yankle Candle website show the same poor quality feedback. I contacted Yankee Xandke and was told the Amazon Store that's called Yankee Candke isn't Yankee Candle. So, no guarantees.  And the Amazon ""Yankee Candle"" won't reply.",1.0,2021-12-21,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000WUFVR0/?pageNumber=4,positive
Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Home Sweet Home,B000WUFVR0,Kindle Customer,Very disappointed. I don't buy many Yankee candles because they are too expensive for my budget. I splurged on this one since it is Christmas season. I love the Christmas smell of balsam and the spicy scent of cloves. This candle has very little scent (had scent the first time I burned it but that has faded out) and what it has smells more like baby powder. Absolutely no clove scent at all and no balsam scent either. I paid almost $30 for this candle and it will it in the closet because it's pretty worthless as to making the house smell nice.,1.0,2021-12-14,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000WUFVR0/?pageNumber=4,positive

The second one wasn’t that bad so I kept it & it’s actually almost all gone because I’ve been burning it. I was a big fan of Yankee candles because you could always smell the scent through out your house but I didn’t find that with this one? Not sure why??

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Spiced Pumpkin,B000W3V8S8,Joe E.,"I have purchased many different brands of candles over the years trying to find a company that competes in its fragrances with Yankee candles. I finally decided several years ago that I would only buy Yankee candles and stop wasting my money on the other brands, since I am always disappointed with them. I was thrilled when I found my favorite Cranberry Chutney jar candle available on Amazon a couple of weeks before Christmas. However, as I have burned it over the past several days, I have been extremely disappointed. My house used to be filled with the delicious aroma from this candle, but this time, I can barely smell it. I have heard the excuse that people are complaining about Yankee candles' scents this year due to a loss of smell from Covid-19. That is not the case with me, because I have not contracted covid, and my sense of smell is just fine. If other people are complaining, I have a feeling the Yankee Candle Company has changed something in the way it adds the different fragrances to their candles, so now, they are less potent than they always have been. I want a candle that can fill my house with a delicious scent, not one that I have to keep trying to smell! If you are expecting the Yankee Candle of old when you purchase this one, you will be disappointed.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Spiced Pumpkin,B000W3V8S8,Mimi,"I am very disappointed in this Yankee candle. I have been buying authentic Yankee Candles for more than 20 years. This my first Yankee Candle purchase on Amazon. In the past, I have always purchased from Hallmark Stores or Bed, Bath & Beyond, and never suffered a low quality Yankee Candle. This candle from Amazon vendor has a very weak scent. Past purchases had scents so strong the fragrance required burning a short 10 minutes only.  I have burned this fake candle almost 2 hours to only get a faint Autumn Harvest scent by sniffing near the jar. Having bought a same scent Yankee Candle from a reputable, authorized dealer, I am astounded at the difference being night & day. This is a knock-off Yankee Candle and my last purchase of such on Amazon. I would not recommend any fragrance offered of this cheaper version. You get what you pay for…buyer beware!

It worked so I keep them burning all day, up until I go to bed for the night.  Yankee Candle is one of a kind and burns just right.

This was my first time purchasing a Yankee Candle and I was looking forward to enjoying this scent in my home. I was sadly mistaken. This candle do not have a scent. I literally have to lean over the candle and even then I can barely smell anything. The scent fades so quickly that even when the candle is burning, you still can not hardly smell it. I paid $18.00 for this candle which more than I have ever paid for a candle before. I get stronger scented candles from the Dollar Tree that smell better than this one.

That is a huge factor for me.  I've purchased a couple different brands through Amazon that have arrived shattered. Only to have them replaced to have the replacement arrive shattered also. How does that? Yankee candle goes to great lengths to ensure their candles arrive to you just as they suppose to, all in one piece. This candle might be a bit strong smelling for some people, I however enjoy the deep woodsy smell this one gives off.  It's also a long burning candle.  Not one that you will light and then be almost empty  in a few short hours. I very much like that.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Balsam & Cedar,B000JDGC78,Jeff H.,"Once upon a time, Yankee Candles were premium scented candles. These days, not so much. I bought two candles, one Balsam & Cedar and the other Autumn Wreath.  You can barely smell the scents of either, even after burning for a substantial period of time. You can smell them if you hold your nose up to the candle, but the scent just doesn’t dissipate much once lit. I’m incredibly disappointed and most likely will be submitting a return on BOTH candles. And this is definitely not the first time this has happened. The quality of their candles has clearly went downhill in recent years.

Fast forward a couple of weeks. Once the candle had burned down about an inch, all of the scent disappeared. I am so disappointed. I have practically a whole candle that has no aroma.

"Yankee Candle Large 2-Wick Tumbler Candle, Spiced Pumpkin",B004USM1A0,Joe E.,"I have purchased many different brands of candles over the years trying to find a company that competes in its fragrances with Yankee candles. I finally decided several years ago that I would only buy Yankee candles and stop wasting my money on the other brands, since I am always disappointed with them. I was thrilled when I found my favorite Cranberry Chutney jar candle available on Amazon a couple of weeks before Christmas. However, as I have burned it over the past several days, I have been extremely disappointed. My house used to be filled with the delicious aroma from this candle, but this time, I can barely smell it. I have heard the excuse that people are complaining about Yankee candles' scents this year due to a loss of smell from Covid-19. That is not the case with me, because I have not contracted covid, and my sense of smell is just fine. If other people are complaining, I have a feeling the Yankee Candle Company has changed something in the way it adds the different fragrances to their candles, so now, they are less potent than they always have been. I want a candle that can fill my house with a delicious scent, not one that I have to keep trying to smell! If you are expecting the Yankee Candle of old when you purchase this one, you will be disappointed.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar, Christmas Cookie",B000C2TB6U,RH24,I'm likely upon the last 2-3 hours of burn time on my candle...so I have stopped using it and ordered two more to have in place to use Christmas Eve/day.

"Yankee Candle Large Jar, Christmas Cookie",B000C2TB6U,master Irrigator,The candle arrived well packaged so that it would not break.  I have only burnt it for 1 evening so far and it smells great. Not much more you can say. It melted evenly across the candle.  Not the strongest scent. So if you want a super strong scent then this is not it. It is very inviting.

Yankee Candle 1218400Z Large Jar Candle Kitchen Spice,B0057I5TIS,Just sayin'..,"I have had this scent for almost 20 years, give it take. The last one I had was bought about 5ish years ago and cycled seasonly with other Yankee Candles. It definitely always had a cinnamon smell but not like this. This one is almost satirical! This Home Sweet Home candle has such an exaggerated cinnamon smell, it burns the throat to smell it! You'll notice I made a point to let it be known I haven't bought a HSH Yankee candle in about 5 years. I did that incase Yankee has changed the formula to increase the Cinnamon. Or maybe it was a mistake buying on Amazon? Maybe it's a second? Or maybe I am just getting old and my olfactory glands are 'going' first? The only problem with the latter is the previous HSH candle I had was at it's wicks end and I was able to compare. So if it's my olfactory senses, they went haywire overnight. Yankee offers candles with Cinnamon in the name to let it be known cinnamon is what you're going to get. Wow, if they are more 'cinnamony' than this, it would double as a tear gas agent. Just imagine putting a Yankee cinnamon candle on a warmer during the holidays. One could clear out any family or friend visitors from sheer discomfort alone! This HSH is more than half way there. One could use this to politely clear any guests out of the home. It's just too much!",2.0,2021-12-19,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0057I5TIS/?pageNumber=2,positive

I bought this to give to someone for a housewarming gift because the name of the candle is Home Sweet Home. I was very happy with the way this candle was packaged. It was wrapped very well in a shell of fitted cardboard and then boxed. It was delivered quickly and was completely intact, which is great because the candle is in a glass jar. I think this candle was too expensive, but I think all Yankee Candles are too expensive.

Huge waste of money. They smell great and look great until you start using them. Reviews on the Yankle Candle website show the same poor quality feedback.

This candle has very little scent (had scent the first time I burned it but that has faded out) and what it has smells more like baby powder. Absolutely no clove scent at all and no balsam scent either.

I knew that person and she always has a very clean house. I had a cat myself but she couldn’t smell any cat smells. I keep a clean litter box because I cannot live with the smell.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Sage & Citrus,B000P6THK8,D.,"I saw this candle at a friends house and love the scent. My friend said her husband had the candle for 10 years. I went on Amazon and read the reviews. I noticed most people said the candle had a very faint smell and the scent wasn't as strong as it used to be. I was hoping the company had read the reviews and it had improved the scent. Unfortunately, this is not the case. My candle arrived yesterday. I had high hopes for this candle. This was my first time purchasing a Yankee Candle and I was looking forward to enjoying this scent in my home. I was sadly mistaken. This candle do not have a scent. I literally have to lean over the candle and even then I can barely smell anything. The scent fades so quickly that even when the candle is burning, you still can not hardly smell it. I paid $18.00 for this candle which more than I have ever paid for a candle before. I get stronger scented candles from the Dollar Tree that smell better than this one. I will never purchase this brand again.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Sage & Citrus,B000P6THK8,Scottyre,"I have always liked Yankee candles. This is one of my favorite scents.  Their candles have always burned well for me and this is no exception.  I especially like the way they are packaged and shipped. There is no way they will arrive broken to your home. That is a huge factor for me.  I've purchased a couple different brands through Amazon that have arrived shattered. Only to have them replaced to have the replacement arrive shattered also. How does that? Yankee candle goes to great lengths to ensure their candles arrive to you just as they suppose to, all in one piece. This candle might be a bit strong smelling for some people, I however enjoy the deep woodsy smell this one gives off.  It's also a long burning candle.  Not one that you will light and then be almost empty  in a few short hours. I very much like that. No one likes spending extra money on a quality candle only to have it burn down in a few short hours.  Between the wonderful scents they have that are true to their name, and the longevity of their burn time, this has been bringing me back as a very happy repeat customer for years",5.0,2021-11-29,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000P6THK8/?pageNumber=3,positive

I'll update this review after I've had this candle lit for a few hours but until then I am not impressed. UPDATE- Well I've been burning this candle in our bathroom off and on for a few days now and I must admit that I don't mind this scent.  In my personal opinion it smells terrible straight from the jar but the scent that the candle releases when it's burning is actually pretty nice.  The scent isn't my all time favorite but I wouldn't mind purchasing this again.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Sage & Citrus,B000P6THK8,J. W.,Yankee candles rarely disappoint in terms of their longevity and quality. I love this particular scent - it has a darker profile than many of Yankee’s other fragrance options. Unfortunately my partner commented “that smells like Axe” and I’m not sure I can argue with him.

Yankee Candle Dried Lavender & Oak​ Signature Small Tumbler Candle,B08TZT1N2C,Bloom W.,I usually buy these more expensive Yankee candles because their smells are strong and can fill up my living room.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Fresh Cut Roses,B00069ZDJS,Deborah,"I love my yankee candle. I have sinus problems so finding a candle I can smell is difficult. I lift the lids in the stores & if I can’t smell it I won’t buy it. Yankee candles have always had a great scent. I had a woman come over once when I had the lid off the jar as she came up my stairs she said “Thank Heaven , Scented candles” The previous place she went smelled like cats and dogs. I knew that person and she always has a very clean house. I had a cat myself but she couldn’t smell any cat smells. I keep a clean litter box because I cannot live with the smell. It gets cleaned after every use and taken outside to the trash . The other lady taught me that so I know her litter was clean.

Lived half of my life without an opinion either way, don't know how I ever managed. Must admit, this Lilac Blossom scent is simply excellent.  A definite favorite of ours. Yankee Candle (JAR TYPE) are a favorite of ours.  Price is right too. We like aromatic candles that last.  Some are very expensive and yet, I have to put my beak practically into the flame in order to recognize a hint of an aroma.  Big League Taboo for this 52 yr old kids beak, as I blister easily not to mention the discolored tip which is generally black or in a shade thereof. Not to mention it simply does nothing for my looks. But not with these Large Jar Yankee Candles with so much aroma. My beak is safe at last. Thank you Yankee Candle.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Café Al Fresco,B01NAAQLZ1,Susan,"I was never really a ""candle person"" until my next door neighbor's cigarette smoke started to waif over to our side of our townhouse.  Enter Yankee Candle... One of my favorite flavors and aromas is vanilla, so of course I ordered two Vanilla Cupcake candles to not only enjoy but to try and combat the lovely flavor with the pungent odor of cigarette smoke.  It worked so I keep them burning all day, up until I go to bed for the night.  Yankee Candle is one of a kind and burns just right.

So i tested and made sure by lighting a different candle from bath and body works. I was able to smell that candle perfectly. So for some reason the Yankee Candle reviews are correct by my nose.,1.0,2021-12-31,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01NAAQLZ1/?pageNumber=17,positive

Yankee Candle 1073481EZ Large Jar Candle Lemon Lavender,B000WQZ5PC,MilsNY,"I bought this for the first time shortly before Christmas 2021 and lit it for several hours almost every day. The scent is very strong, and it smells like real so yummy - a delicious combination of lavender and lemon. I've been looking for a scent with lavender essential oils for a while, because of the great benefits in relaxing the spirit. Combining lavender with lemon is perfect for me, as it relaxes me but also uplifts me, and so I used this during the day, and absolutely LOVE it. I extinguish the flame by putting back the lid, so the smoke stays inside the container. I noticed that the smell lasts long even after I had extinguished it, and even the days I don't lit it and the container is closed I can still smell the scent. Super high quality and lovely. Highly recommended. NOTE - I have never tested CVD  positive in the two years here in NYC, and never lost my sense of smell.",5.0,2021-12-28,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000WQZ5PC,positive

For this particular scent, I was looking for a lavender scented candle specifically to burn in the evening to relax me before going to bed.

Yankee Candle 1073481EZ Large Jar Candle Lemon Lavender,B000WQZ5PC,MilsNY,"I bought this for the first time shortly before Christmas 2021 and lit it for several hours almost every day. The scent is very strong, and it smells like real so yummy - a delicious combination of lavender and lemon. I've been looking for a scent with lavender essential oils for a while, because of the great benefits in relaxing the spirit. Combining lavender with lemon is perfect for me, as it relaxes me but also uplifts me, and so I used this during the day, and absolutely LOVE it. I extinguish the flame by putting back the lid, so the smoke stays inside the container. I noticed that the smell lasts long even after I had extinguished it, and even the days I don't lit it and the container is closed I can still smell the scent. Super high quality and lovely. Highly recommended. NOTE - I have never tested CVD  positive in the two years here in NYC, and never lost my sense of smell.",5.0,2021-12-28,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000WQZ5PC/?pageNumber=1,positive

Takes a while to get going and would probably have been more effective as a 3-wick rather than 2-wick candle.  Scent throw is very good, subtle but pervasive over a wide area and remains in the air for a while after the candle is extinguished/covered.  The scent is very floral, pleasant, but I don't pick up the advertised lime/jasmine tea. As one reviewer has noted, after the candle burns down a bit, it really does look like a brain.  There are channels throughout the candle, making it look like the amygdala.  Perhaps a cost-cutting measure, candle burns using less wax. This candle was a nice one-off, nothing about the candle that would compel me to purchase it again.",3.0,2021-10-29,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07P9S8VZR/?pageNumber=2,positive

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Autumn Wreath",B000TVJ6XW,Joe E.,"I have purchased many different brands of candles over the years trying to find a company that competes in its fragrances with Yankee candles. I finally decided several years ago that I would only buy Yankee candles and stop wasting my money on the other brands, since I am always disappointed with them. I was thrilled when I found my favorite Cranberry Chutney jar candle available on Amazon a couple of weeks before Christmas. However, as I have burned it over the past several days, I have been extremely disappointed. My house used to be filled with the delicious aroma from this candle, but this time, I can barely smell it. I have heard the excuse that people are complaining about Yankee candles' scents this year due to a loss of smell from Covid-19. That is not the case with me, because I have not contracted covid, and my sense of smell is just fine. If other people are complaining, I have a feeling the Yankee Candle Company has changed something in the way it adds the different fragrances to their candles, so now, they are less potent than they always have been. I want a candle that can fill my house with a delicious scent, not one that I have to keep trying to smell! If you are expecting the Yankee Candle of old when you purchase this one, you will be disappointed.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle French Vanilla,B000W3T9GG,Susan,"I was never really a ""candle person"" until my next door neighbor's cigarette smoke started to waif over to our side of our townhouse.  Enter Yankee Candle... One of my favorite flavors and aromas is vanilla, so of course I ordered two Vanilla Cupcake candles to not only enjoy but to try and combat the lovely flavor with the pungent odor of cigarette smoke.  It worked so I keep them burning all day, up until I go to bed for the night.  Yankee Candle is one of a kind and burns just right.
