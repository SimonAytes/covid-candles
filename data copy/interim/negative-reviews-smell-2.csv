Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Bahama Breeze,B004G9DV66,CustomerOne,"These things are up to $30 now with sales around $16-20 vs finding sales for $6 just a few years back. This one smells decent if you sniff the jar but after being lit for 8+ hours in one sitting I still cant tell there is a scented candle in the room.  The freaking 2in dollar general one I had lit the day before it arrived filled the room. Low Quality & Double the cost.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Bahama Breeze,B004G9DV66,Jessy Kissinger,"ITEM ARRIVED BROKEN! Could’ve been Amazons fault. Could’ve been Yankee Candles fault. Could’ve been the USPS fault.

I filed for a replacement and Amazon is not requiring me to return the broken one, which is great, but the estimated date of deliver is Mid-Late April(as I’m writing this, it’s March 26th).

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Café Al Fresco,B01NAAQLZ1,Christine Berkebile,I'm so sad.  In February I ordered 4 of the Salted Caramel candies intending on giving out 3 as gifts and burning one myself.  It emits absolutely no scent! I would be embarrassed to give the other 3 as gifts.  I am stuck with 4 scentless candles. Definitely not like any other Yankee candles I've had before!

"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Silver Birch",B00J6CH1VO,L. L.,"After decades of buying Yankee Candles I have noticed a steady decline in scent. Now I have 4 large jars in one room.

I realized recently a corporation purchased Yankee Candles, from the original owner, and he died. Again, I see the results of what happens when a greedy corporation buys anything good. They ruin it, and perhaps cut back or use a cheaper essential oil. Whatever they're doing, it's a shame. This decline has gone on for years, and I have had it! Why must corporation buy great companies and ruin what was once the best candle on the market?  From now on, I will purchase candles elsewhere, from another company..Perhaps the original sons new Candle company will return to create the original great scented candles.

Cinnamon Roll Scented Candles for Home | Non Toxic Long Lasting Soy Candles | Delicious Scent | Large 16 oz Mason Jar | Hand Made in The USA,B07WDYMGZN,Austin Lautenbach,"I rarely if ever write amazon reviews but this is likely one of my most disappointing items I've ever purchased. I recently ran out of my B&BW 20oz pumpkin candle which I loved, but I thought I'd try a smaller brand for a change. I was very disappointed for the following reasons: - the candle lacks any scent other than a faint smoke. I used it in a small 8x10 room with no external windows opened and I was unable to smell any difference at all, even from 2 feet away - the candle does not burn effectively and went out on me multiple times. I followed the lighting instructions to the T meaning cutting the wick to the correct length, cleaning out any debris, and always burning within the reccomended time limit. I still had it go out multiple times - this candle has severe tunneling issues. I think the wick might be too small for the diameter of the jar, because my candle melted out the inside only and left thick wax walls around the edges. Again, this was all while following the correct use instructions - the candle is tiny for its price. I realize it is listed as 8oz so I was expecting it to be small, but in light of the other problems listed above this seems an unacceptable price to size ratio. You can easily get 18 or 20 oz candles on this site that are better. Overall, I am disappointed and would not recommend this product to anyone. You're probably better off burning a generic unscented wax candle as it will give you the same effect and probably won't go out as much.",1.0,2021-01-25,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07WDYMGZN/?pageNumber=3,negative
