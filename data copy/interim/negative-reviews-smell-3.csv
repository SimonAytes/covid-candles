Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Bahama Breeze,B004G9DV66,CustomerOne,"These things are up to $30 now with sales around $16-20 vs finding sales for $6 just a few years back. This one smells decent if you sniff the jar but after being lit for 8+ hours in one sitting I still cant tell there is a scented candle in the room.  The freaking 2in dollar general one I had lit the day before it arrived filled the room. Low Quality & Double the cost.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Sage & Citrus,B000P6THK8,Chris W.,"Sage and Citrus has been my favorite scent since the 90’s. This was absolute junk. There was absolutely no scent throw when lit; no one in my house could smell it burning. The old Yankee Candles would scent my whole house. It was hard for me to believe this was even an actual Yankee Candle, so I looked it up and discovered the original owner of Yankee Candle now owns Kringle Candle and still uses the old Yankee family recipes. I’m going to order from there and hopefully have better luck. I hate when tried and true companies cut corners and think no one will notice.

I recently ran out of my B&BW 20oz pumpkin candle which I loved, but I thought I'd try a smaller brand for a change. I was very disappointed for the following reasons: - the candle lacks any scent other than a faint smoke. I used it in a small 8x10 room with no external windows opened and I was unable to smell any difference at all, even from 2 feet away - the candle does not burn effectively and went out on me multiple times. I followed the lighting instructions to the T meaning cutting the wick to the correct length, cleaning out any debris, and always burning within the reccomended time limit. I still had it go out multiple times - this candle has severe tunneling issues. I think the wick might be too small for the diameter of the jar, because my candle melted out the inside only and left thick wax walls around the edges. Again, this was all while following the correct use instructions - the candle is tiny for its price. I realize it is listed as 8oz so I was expecting it to be small, but in light of the other problems listed above this seems an unacceptable price to size ratio. You can easily get 18 or 20 oz candles on this site that are better. Overall, I am disappointed and would not recommend this product to anyone. You're probably better off burning a generic unscented wax candle as it will give you the same effect and probably won't go out as much.",1.0,2021-01-25,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07WDYMGZN/?pageNumber=3,negative

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Macintosh,B007FSDIJA,Toby Moore,"This was purchased as a small Valentine's gift for my wife.  I had bought her a Lemon Verbena candle (different brand) for Christmas, which smelled really nice.  But then we noticed the terrible black soot it left on her home office walls and ceiling...so much for buying another.  She's had dozens of Yankee candles over the years with no issues, and this one was ""Amazon's Choice"" so I went for it.  Simply put, this jar missed the fragrance nozzle on the assembly line.  We're talking basically no lemon, unless you concentrate it in a very small location.  And even then you have to practically singe your eyebrows off leaning into it to smell anything.  Nothing like other Yankee stuff in the past.  Production mistake?  Yankee's new cost-cutting philosophy?  Who knows.  Just $17 wasted.  We'll go back to generic candles bought at the supermarket.

Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Balsam & Cedar,B000JDGC78,David Beblo,I bought the Balsam & Cedar for the Christmas Season. It does smell nice when I walk past it but otherwise you'd never know that there was a lit candle in the room. My whole house is only 1084 square feet. I used to be able to smell a REAL Yankee Candle throughout the house. Not Anymore! Ever since Yankee Candle was sold their candles are no better than Dollar Tree candles.

I have Village Candles that I can smell just fine and have no issues tasting or smelling what I eat or drink. When will we stop blaming everything on COVID?!? The candle has one wick and is very pretty. There is zero scent when burning the candle. I purchased one for us and another to give as a gift. The lack of scent when being burned, I will donate the second one.
